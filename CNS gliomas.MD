/LGG - Low Grade Gliomas

GRADE I:

Tx: If GTR, observe.

If STR, post op RT improves RFS.

 In children, this is usually JPA in cerebellum or optic pathway.

 In adults, usually hypothalamic pilocytic astrocytoma.

PostOp RT to 50.4-54 Gy. (Shaw, 1989, low grade astros)

/JPA - juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma

Grade 1

(kids, benign even tho histo looks scary, Rosenthal fibers) Don't use T2 MRI.

Treat: Surgery only, even re-resect if possible, if not, then chemo. RT only for 1st or second recurrence, treat to 50-54Gy to gross residual and tumor bed.)

MRI T2 sequence best to see most LGG (cuz they don’t enhance) except Pilocytic Astrocytoma.

GRADE II:

oligodendrogliomas, mixed oligoastrocytomas, pure astrocytomas

/LGG Treatment

 LOW RISK: If GTR and age<40 => OBSERVE

 HIGH RISK: If age>=40 or STR => 54Gy + Chemo

LGG Dose, Fields: On MRI, T2+2cm to 45Gy, then boost T2+1cm to 54Gy

5yr survival is

70% for oligo

56-63% for mixed

311 pts.

RT Dose: 54/1.8. (GTV+2cm to 45Gy, then cone down to GTV+1cm to 54Gy) (GTV from CT)

No chemo.

Salvage RT is very effective. Decreased sz.

Concluded that Delayed RT OK if younger pt p/w sz only.

Poor Prognostic Factors: (see Pignatti above)

At progression, showed re-bx shows higher grade transformation, independent of whether they got RT. So RT for LGG does NOT increase malignant transformation.

From 2005 to 2009, 129 evaluable patients (75 males and 54 females) were accrued. Median age was 49 years; 91% had a Zubrod score of 0 or 1; and 69%, 25%, and 6% of patients had 3, 4, and 5 risk factors, respectively. Patients had median and minimum follow-up examinations of 4.1 years and 3 years, respectively. The 3-year OS rate was 73.1% (95% confidence interval: 65.3%-80.8%), which was significantly improved compared to that of prespecified historical control values (P<.001). Median survival time has not yet been reached. Three-year progression-free survival was 59.2%. Grades 3 and 4 adverse events occurred in 43% and 10% of patients, respectively. One patient died of herpes encephalitis.

/AOA Anaplastic Mixed Oligoastrocytoma

2 papers on +/-PCV same issue jco 2006 about AO and AOA (below).

Both showed improved pfs, not os.

1p19q always did better.

But PCV very toxic w/ high myelosuppression, so people are now extrapolating to try TMZ, which may work as well with less toxicity. (Is that why these 2 papers are not as relevant any more?)

Crocker says: if 1p19q deleted, more responsive to chemo, so he recommends chemo alone. (PCV or TMZ??) (but don't you need RT cuz anaplastic is WHO Grade III ?)

EORTC 26951, AO or AOA. (Updated ASCO 2012)

Immed vs delayed chemo. All pts received RT.

RT then immed PCV vs RT alone (delayed PCV).

RT 59.4, then +/-PCV x 6 cycles.

For RT alone arm, add PCV at progression.

368 pts.

Update ASCO 2012: (140 mo FU)

Now at 140 mo FU, PCV yielded improved OS and PFS for all pts.

Median OS 42mo vs 31mo. HR 0.75.

Median PFS 24mo v 13mo. HR 0.66.

Among 1p19q deleted pts,

Median OS (not reached) vs 112mo. HR 0.56

Median PFS 157mo v 50mo. HR 0.42.

Among NON-deleted pts,

Median OS 25mo v 21mo. HR 0.83.

Median PFS 15mo v 9mo. HR 0.73.

1p19q deleted pts showed better PFS, OS w/ PCV.

Now this marker is considered both prognostic and predictive.

Definitely need chemo if you are 1p19q deleted!

was JCO 2006, "DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.6078". For AO or AOA.

FU of 60 months.

Immediate PCV improves PFS but not OS.

Improved Median PFS 23 mo vs 13 mo.

Since no diff in OS, concluded that timing of PCV is not critical, can be given later at progression.

1p19q deleted pts all did better, regardless of PCV.

PCV is toxic: Only 1/3 of pts completed all 6 cycles of PCV, due to myelosuppression.

Comments: But what about effect of delayed PCV on neurocognition, functional status?

RTOG /9402, JCO 2006 ("DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2005.04.3414")

PCV before RT, for AO, AOA.

1p19q pts all did better.

PCV improved PFS (2.6 mo v 1.7 mo), but with more toxicity (65% had G3-4 toxicity).

No OS diff.

UPDATED 2012 ASCO Abstract -- "Chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (CT-RT) versus RT alone for patients with anaplasticoligodendroglioma: Long-term results of the RTOG 9402 phase III study." (Cairncross JG, J Clin Oncol 30, 2012 (suppl; abstr 2008b))

Median f/u 11.3 yr. Median PFS 2.5 vs 1.7 yr. 1p/19q codeletion associated with median MS 8.7 yr vs 2.7 yr. For the entire cohort, no difference in MS by treatment (p=0.1). However, pts with 1p/19q deleted tumors had improved survival with PCT+RT (14.7 yr) than with RT alone (7.3 yr). No difference in MS by treatment in pts without 1q/19q del.

Conclusion: "PCV followed by immediate RT was a highly effective therapy for patients with 1p/19q co-deleted AO/AOA. In this setting, 1p/19q co-deletion was both prognostic and predictive, and the early PFS benefit in co-deleted cases was a harbinger of their longer OS."

TMZ for grade III?

Nevertheless, a retrospective study on 1054 patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma, presented during the 2009 ASCO Annual Meeting, suggests that PCV therapy may be superior in efficacy to the newer temozolomide therapy. Median time to progression for patients with 1p19q co-deletion was longer following PCV alone (7.6 years) than with temozolomide alone (3.3 years); median overall survival was also longer with PCV treatment versus temozolomide treatment (not reached, vs. 7.1 years)

Median survival was 4.9 months versus 8.9 months, respectively (P < 0.0001). The survival detriment with SCRT persisted on multivariable analysis [HR 1.51 (95% CI: 1.33–1.73, P < 0.0001)], adjusting for age, gender, race, comorbidities, diagnosis year, facility type, surgery, and chemotherapy. In conclusion, hypofractionated SCRT was associated with worse survival compared to conventionally fractionated LCRT for elderly patients with GBM. Patients who received SCRT were older with worse comorbidities, and were less likely to undergo chemotherapy or resection.

UPTODATE 2022:
A randomized controlled trial (RCT) and several retrospective studies conducted in the elderly suggest that short course radiation therapy (SCRT) of 34–40 Gy in 2.6–3.4 Gy fractions, with or without TMZ, may have similar results to LCRT 23, 24, 25. Results from the Nordic trial suggested that SCRT may be superior to LCRT in patients aged ≥70 years 26. Based on the available data, SCRT is recommended in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines as a Category 1 treatment option for patients >70 years old with Karnofsky performance status (KPS) of ≥60 or <60 27.

A. 60 Gy of radiation over 6 weeks versus 40 Gy of radiation over 3 weeks [Roa]

B. 60 Gy of radiation with temozolomide versus radiation alone [Stupp]

*C. 50.4 Gy of radiation versus best supportive care alone [Keime-Guibert]

D. 40 Gy of radiation over 3 weeks with temozolomide versus 40 Gy of radiation over 3 weeks alone [EORTC/NCIC]


RATIONALE: The Roa trial demonstrated the same survival outcome with 60 Gy of radiation therapy in 6 weeks as with 40 Gy of radiation in 3 weeks. The Stupp trial did not enroll patients older than 70 years of age. 
Radiation therapy of 40 Gy in 3 weeks with or without temozolomide (TMZ) is being tested in the EORTC/NCIC trial.

A PHASE III RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL OF SHORT-COURSE RADIOTHERAPY WITH OR WITHOUT CONCOMITANT AND ADJUVANT TEMOZOLOMIDE IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH GLIOBLASTOMA (NCIC CTG CE.6, EORTC 26062-22061, TROG 08.02, NCT00482677)
>65yo
40 Gy in 3 weeks with or without temozolomide (TMZ)
Study ended July 2015.
Results: 562 pts. Addition of TMZ to short course RT improved OS 9.3m v 7.6mo, improved PFS 5.3m v 3.9m. For MGMT+, TMZ improved OS 13.5m v 7.7m. Toxicities: TMZ had worse N/V, constipation.
Conclusion: concurrent short course RT w/ TMZ tolerable, all pts benefit, but MGMT+ benefit more.

/TMZ, Temodar for GBM:

/TMZ /Temodar /Temozolomide - a 2nd generation alkylating agent, a prodrug that crosses BBB, converts to MTIC, which methylates DNA.  

Dosing

 For GBM: w/ CRT 75 mg/m2/d x 42d during RT (7d/wk), then maint TMZ x 6 cycles or more if improving (150-200 mg/m2/d x5d q28d, (or new dosing is 75mg/m2/d x21d out of 28 days)).

From MedScape 2016: "The standard of care is surgical resection followed by EBRT (60 Gy in 30-35 fractions) and adjuvant temozolomide 75 mg/m 2/day PO on days 1-42, usually 1-1.5h before radiation."

NEW, take TMZ one hour before RT!

(Used to be at night on empty stomach.)

TMZ side effects: N/V, myelosuppression (thrombocytopenia) MONITOR PLATELETS, need PCP prophylaxis due to lymphopenia (Bactrim DS MWF)

Prior to dosing, patients must have an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 x 109/Land a platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L. A complete blood count should be obtained on Day 22 (21 days after the first dose) or within 48 hours of that day, and weekly until the ANC is above 1.5x 109/Land platelet count exceeds 100x 109/L. Geriatric patients and women have been shown in clinical trials to have a higher risk of developing myelosuppression.

Also, check HebB status before start.

Fatal and severe hepatotoxicity have been reported in patients receiving Temodar. Perform liver function tests at baseline, midway through the first cycle, prior to each subsequent cycle, and approximately two to four weeks after the last dose of Temodar.

Advances in the management of glioblastoma: the role of temozolomide and MGMT testing
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/CPAA.S26586

 Two recent randomized studies demonstrated that TMZ alone is a reasonable, noninferior option for patients older than 65 years who may not tolerate the combined regimen.
 
Patients with MGMT promoter methylation had a significant survival benefit when treated on the TMZ arms, but no survival benefit when receiving radiotherapy alone. 
This suggests MGMT-positive patients who cannot tolerate the combined regimen should receive TMZ rather than radiation.Citation45,Citation46

This study showed that MGMT promoter methylation was associated with better PFS and OS in patients with GBM regardless of therapeutic intervention, and associated with longer OS in GBM patients treated with alkylating agents.

Some studies shows MGMT+ have better response to TMZ.

/IDH1 mutation+

 inversely associated with grade in diffuse glial tumors, affecting 71% of grade II, 64% of grade III, and 6% of primary glioblastomas 

IDH1 mutations are present in the majority of common (G II and G III) adult gliomas and also in secondary GBMs (76%) but rare in primary glioblastomas.  Secondary GBMs are those that start out as a lower grade astrocytic tumor and then progress to WHO G IV.  Only present in 3% of primary GBMs.

In grade III tumors, the median survival time of patients with mutated IDH1 is about fourfold higher than that for patients with wt IDH1 (81.1 months versus 19.4 months, respectively

For secondary GBMs, significantly longer survival (mean, 27.1 versus 11.3 months).

IDH1/2 mutation is a prognostic marker for survival and predicts response to chemotherapy for grade II gliomas concomitantly treated with radiation therapy

DOI: 10.3892/ijo.2012.1564

Reliable prognostic biomarkers of grade II gliomas remain unclear. This study aimed to examine the role of mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1/2), 1p/19q co-deletion, and clinicopathological factors in patients with grade II glioma who were primarily treated with radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy after surgery. Seventy-two consecutive patients, including 49 cases of diffuse astrocytomas (DA), 4 oligodendrogliomas (OL) and 19 oligoastrocytomas (OA), who underwent treatment from 1991 to 2010 at a single institution were examined. The overall survival (OS) of the DA patients (8.3 years) was significantly shorter than that of the OL and OA patients (11.7 years). IDH1/2 mutations were found in 46.9% of the DA patients and 82.6% of the OL and OA patients. The progression-free survival (PFS) and OS of the patients with IDH1/2 mutations (8.4 and 16.3 years) were significantly longer than those of the patients without IDH1/2 mutations (3.3 and 4.5 years). Among the patients with IDH1/2 mutations, those who were initially treated with chemoradiotherapy including nimustine hydrochloride (ACNU), had significantly longer PFS than those treated with radiotherapy alone, whereas no significant difference in PFS was observed between the chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy groups in the patients without IDH1/2 mutations. Oligodendroglial tumors, age <40 years, initial Karnofsky performance status (KPS) ≥80, and IDH1/2 mutations were favorable prognostic factors regarding PFS and OS. IDH1/2 mutation was a predictive factor of response to chemoradiotherapy in grade II gliomas. Patients with IDH1/2 mutations may benefit more from chemoraiotherapy than those without IDH1/2 mutations.

Maintenance Therapy With Tumor-Treating Fields (TTF) Plus Temozolomide vs Temozolomide Alone for Glioblastoma

A Randomized Clinical Trial

JAMA. 2015;314(23):2535-2543. 

doi:10.1001/jama.2015.16669

Results: Improved OS (20.9 mos vs 16 mos) and PFS (6.7 mos v 4 mos), independent of MGMT status.

Toxicities: In the EF-14 trial for newly diagnosed GBM patients, where the treatment exposure was longer than that for recurrent disease, grades 1 and 2 skin reactions were reported in 43% of patients. Severe (grade 3) reactions were again seen in only 2% of patients.
