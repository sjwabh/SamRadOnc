Spinal cord RT dose limits, toxicities:

Fractionated radiation — A Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic (QUANTEC) study, sponsored by the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) and the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM), analyzed the literature on the risk of chronic radiation myelopathy as a function of the total dose of radiation, the extent of the spinal cord included in the treatment field, and the size of individual treatment fractions [13].

In this review, using a conventional fractionation schedule (2 Gy per day) and including the entire cross section of the spinal cord, total doses of 50 Gy, 60 Gy, and 69 Gy were associated with risks of chronic myelopathy of 0.2, 6, and 50 percent, respectively.

Hypofractionated radiation — Hypofractionated radiation employs dose and fractionation schedules with a daily dose of ≥ 4 Gy per day. It is typically used in combination with techniques for stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

Data on spinal cord tolerance in this setting are complicated by the need to convert various dose and fractionation schedules to a normalized dose. One common method is to use the linear quadratic (LQ) model to calculate the "nBED2/2," which is the 2 Gy equivalent biologic effective dose assuming an alpha/beta ratio of 2. Of note, the reliability of the LQ model in settings of high dose per fraction is controversial.  

●The QUANTEC study determined that with SBRT to a partial section of the spinal cord, the risk of radiation myelopathy with a single fraction of 13 Gy or 20 Gy divided into three fractions was less than 1 percent [13].

●A multi-institutional experience used nine cases of radiation-induced myelopathy after spine SBRT to build a logistic regression model that estimated risk of radiation myelopathy based on point maximum volume (Pmax) [14]. Using this model, there was a ≤ 5 percent risk of myelopathy when limiting the thecal sac Pmax volume to 12.4 Gy x 1, 17 Gy in two fractions, 20.3 Gy in three fractions, 23 Gy in four fractions, and 25.3 Gy in five fractions [14]. Recommendations were made to limit maximum point doses to the thecal sac of 10 Gy in a single fraction or nBED2/2 of 30 to 35 Gy for up to five fractions [15].

●Practice patterns from an international research consortium reported spinal cord limits that varied from 10 to 11 Gy x 1, 15 to 18 Gy in three fractions, and 20 to 23.75 Gy in five fractions [16]. In most centers, these doses were applied to a 1 to 1.5 mm expansion around the spinal cord.

Re-irradiation — The use of spinal re-irradiation is growing as patients with spinal metastases are living longer and experiencing failures after conventional radiation therapy. In all cases of re-irradiation, caution and conservatism must be used in patient selection, target delineation, and choice of cord tolerance. Preclinical data suggest that there is substantial recovery in primate spinal cord tolerance over time, to 76, 85, and 101 percent of the initial dose at one, two, and three years, respectively [17,18].

The QUANTEC study reviewed 13 single-center series, all of which reported a median interval of ≥ 6 months between radiation courses [13]. No cases of myelopathy were observed for cumulative doses of ≤ 60 Gy in 2 Gy equivalent doses.

In the context of spine SBRT, a multicenter study concluded that re-irradiation appeared to be safe when the following guidelines were all met [19]:

●Five or more months elapsed after conventional radiation

●Re-irradiation thecal sac Pmax nBED2/2 of ≤ 20–25 Gy

●Total Pmax nBED2/2 ≤ 70 Gy

●SBRT thecal sac Pmax nBED comprised ≤ 50 percent of the total nBED

Sx: bitemporal hemianopsia (pressing on chiasm)

In children, confused w/ craniopharyngioma, calcification.

Prolactinoma Tx Options:

 Always try bromocriptine first.

 Transsphenoidal resection.

 RT Indications: STR w/ persistent prolactin elevation, extrasellar extension.

RT Dose: 45-50.4 for non-functioning, 50.4-54 for functioning.  (Fuss 50.4)

Chiasm is most sensitive in pit adenomas (Fuss: TD5/5 50Gy or less, compared w/ 54Gy for others).

The goal of therapy with nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas is tumor growth control; in contrast, the goal of radiation for functioning pituitary adenomas is both tumor growth and biochemical control, which typically require higher radiation doses.

Clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas — Radiation therapy is considered for gonadotroph and other clinically nonfunctioning adenomas:

* When residual adenoma remains after surgery. The rationale is that continued growth is approximately 30 to 60 percent at five years when obvious adenoma tissue, as detected by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), remains after surgery

* When residual adenoma regrows following surgery.

The goal of radiation therapy in this setting is to stop adenoma growth. Shrinkage, partly or completely, may occur but is not necessary to consider the treatment a success.

The type of radiation depends on the proximity of the residual adenoma tissue to the optic pathway and its size.

●Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) can be considered if the adenoma tissue is not within 3 to 5 mm of the optic pathway and is less than 3 cm in diameter. A common SRS dose is 18 to 20 Gy [4,16].

●Fractionated radiation therapy is generally chosen for adenoma tissue that is larger and/or closer to the optic pathway. The usual dose is 45 to 50.4 Gy at 1.8 Gy daily fractions

Efficacy: Either form of radiation controls adenoma size in 90 percent of patients at 5 to 10 years.

SRS for Pituitary:

Steiner

Can do RS for pit adenoma if at least 5mm from the chiasm.

Crocker RS Dose: 14-16 Gy, limits chiasm RS to 10Gy

RS Dose: 14-16Gy, higher for functioning. (>5mm from chiasm)

PS: I am mostly doing either 5 x 5 or conventional fractionation for these. My threshold for chiasm distance is about 3 mm for the 5 x 5 regimen. I limit the dose to the chiasm + 1 mm to 20 Gy.

MGH:

Non-functioning: 12-18Gy

Functioning: 18-20Gy

Pituitary Adenoma outcomes:

10yr DFS

Non-func 80-90%

PRL 80-90%

GH 65%

ACTH 55%

TSH 50% (most aggressive, requires 54Gy)

Regular surveillance for at least a decade after treatment.

Recurrent pituitary adenomas: Dose __?

For patients taking pharmacologic treatment to reduce hormonal secretion by the adenoma, eg, dopamine agonist or somatostatin analog, we suggest discontinuing it for one month prior to and one month following radiation treatment.

/prolactinoma  -

Are prolactinomas resistant to radiation therapy?

This was a multiple choice question and I was deciding between several answers.  According to most textbooks, somewhere between 30 and 50% prolactinomas responsd to radiation therapy, versus 50 to 80% for Cushing’s disease, and 80% for acromegaly.  Mass effect is relieved in 80% of patients with macroadenoma regardless of type.  I was not sure if a response rate of 40% suggests that prolactinomas are resistant to the person who wrote this question.  

/toxicities, pituitary adenoma RT (UpToDate 2016)

Other Damage - uncommon

Optic pathway injury - In two series of 796 patients treated by fractionated radiation, injury to the optic pathway was reported in 0.8 to 1.3 percent at 10 years and 1.5 percent at 20 years [17,38]. Risk is minimized if the dose is kept to 54 Gy or slightly less if there is pre-existing injury to vision [39-41]. For single-dose radiation, the risk of optic pathway injury is minimal if the dose to these structures is kept below 8 to 10 Gy but is approximately one percent at 12 Gy.

Cranial nerve injury - mostly after re-RT

Secondary tumors – The incidence was 1.9 percent at 20 years in two large studies

Strokes  - mostly if already pre-existing risk factors for stroke

Hypopituitarism  - common

In two series of 385 and 884 patients treated with fractionated radiation, new deficiencies of corticotropin (ACTH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and gonadotropins occurred in approximately 20 percent of patients at five years and up to 30 percent at 10 years.

All patients undergoing sellar radiation therapy should be counseled on the high risk of hypopituitarism and the importance of neuroendocrine function surveillance. (See below)

Partial ACTH deficiency may cause symptoms only during stress.

Postural hypotension and tachycardia. Mild, chronic deficiency may result in lassitude, fatigue, anorexia, weight loss, decreased libido, hypoglycemia, and eosinophilia

TSH: fatigue, cold intolerance, decreased appetite, constipation, facial puffiness, dry skin, bradycardia, delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes, and anemia.

FSH,LH: Deficient secretion of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (secondary hypogonadism) in both women and men.

In women, hypogonadism means ovarian hypofunction, which results in decreased estradiol secretion resulting in irregular periods or amenorrhea, anovulatory infertility, vaginal atrophy, and hot flashes.

In men, hypogonadism means testicular hypofunction, which results in infertility and decreased testosterone secretion. The latter causes decreased energy and libido, and hot flashes.

Growth Hormone deficiency in adults include changes in body composition (increased fat mass with a decrease in lean body mass), decreased BMD, impaired quality of life, and increased mortality rates. Adults with growth hormone deficiency may also be more likely to have dyslipidemia, and increased inflammatory markers

/Parinaud’s syndrome (dorsal midbrain syndrome):

Triad of:

 -Paralysis of upgaze

 -Pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils: dilated pupils-accommodate but do not react (to light)

 -convergence-retraction nystagmus when attempting upgaze

Pressure on pre-tectal area, superior colliculus (CN III nucleus, EW nucleus) in dorsal midbrain.

Occurs in pineal gland tumors, multiple sclerosis, brainstem stroke, obstructive hydrocephalus, AVM)

Downward gaze is usually preserved. This vertical palsy is supranuclear, so doll's head maneuver should elevate the eyes, but eventually all upward gaze mechanisms fail.

Pseudo-Argyll Robertson pupils: Accommodative paresis ensues, and pupils become mid-dilated and show light-near dissociation.

Convergence-Retraction nystagmus: On fast up-gaze, the eyes pull in and the globes retract. The easiest way to bring out this reaction is to ask the patient to follow down-going stripes on an optokinetic drum.

Eyelid retraction (Collier's sign)

Conjugate down gaze in the primary position: "setting-sun sign". Neurosurgeons will often see this sign most commonly in patients with failed ventriculoperitoneal shunts.

Staging:

M+ (Disseminated)

 leptomeningeal or intraventricular mets on MRI

 clumps of tumor cells on CSF

 parenchymal tumors

 multiple midline tumors (pineal and suprasellar)

Modified M+ (occult multifocal disease)

 pineal tumor AND diabetes insipidus w/o measurable suprasellar disease

 size reduction (>50%) of pineal or suprasellar region after chemo (ACNS0232 protocol)

M0 (localized disease)

 everything else

Only use chemo in very young to defer RT, or on ACNS0232 protocol (CE prior to reduced dose RT)

TREATMENT:

But don't need surgery cuz very radiosensitive.  

Chemo alone doesn't work.

Standard treatment is Definitive RT alone.

Per control arm of ACNS0232:

If M0 or Modified M+, Whole ventricular RT to 24Gy (1.5/d), boost primary, (infundibulum), 3rd ventricle to 45Gy.

If M+ (Disseminated), CSI to 24Gy, involved field boost to 45Gy.

Involved field is GTV at diagnosis + 1.5cm margin.

Whole Ventricular field: encompasses lateral, third, fourth ventricles + 1.5cm margin.

If sugar coating of craniospinal axis, then CSI 30Gy, boost to 45Gy.

If you gave CE chemo, and then a CR, then RT dose is reduced to 21Gy+9Gy=30Gy total.

If PR, then have to give full dose to 45Gy.

OLD NOTES:

5yr OS 80-90%.

Glial tumors - next MC

pineal parenchymal tumors (3rd MC) - 2 types:

/pineocytoma, WHO Grade II. Tx like LGG. No RT if GTR. If STR, then RT to 1.5cm margin to 50-55Gy. 5yr OS 60-90%.

Meningioma (60% have dural tails)

2007 WHO I,II,III Grading Scheme

WHO Grade I Meningioma

WHO Grade II (atypical): >=4 mitoses/hpf (or 10-20 mitoses?) and/or 3 or more of: increased cellularity, small cells, necrosis, prominent nucleoli, sheeting, &/or brain invasion in an otherwise Grade I tumor (40% recur after surgery alone)

WHO Grade III (anaplastic, 2% of all) (Med Surv 2yrs) >=20 mitoses/hpf and/or resembles carcinoma, sarcoma, or melanoma (no longer brain invasion!)

Is "malignant meningioma" the same as "anaplastic"?

3 bad histologies: angioblastic (hemangiopericytoma), Anaplastic, and papillary(!)

Check for ER, PR, so you can give Tamoxifen, RU-486.

Recommend Primary RT for surgically inaccessible: optic nerve sheath m. (50.4-54Gy), chiasm, brainstem, base of skull, sphenoid wing.

Crocker believes mengiomas should all be treated w/ RT, not surgery.

Even GTR has 4-5% recurrence at 10 yrs.

Indications for PostOp RT:

STR

recurrent

Benign m: incompletely resected (or ALL). 54Gy, 1-2cm margin.

  mean time to recurrence: 4yrs

Malignant m (10%): ALWAYS. 60Gy, 2cm margin.

Outcomes

10 yr OS: 80%

98% LC rate

Benign

10yr LR

 GTR 10%

 STR 80%

 STR+RT 20%

“80/20 rule” – RT Decreases risk of LR from 70-80% to 15-20% s/p STR

Malignant 5yr PFS

MSR+RT 40-50%

84% benign, 16% malignant

Need >52Gy for benign, >53Gy for malignant

Higher doses improved PFS:

Conclusion: Use 54Gy for benign, 60Gy for malignant

/hemangiopericytoma (solitary fibrous tumor, SFT)

Pericytes outside capillaries & post-capillary venules are cell of origin

dura

Usually H&N or base of skull, but can also occur in paranasal sinus.

Looks like meningioma on imaging

Median Survival (5-12yrs) is actually better than anaplastic meningioma (med surv 2yrs).

But this one has distant mets (usually lung) in 25-60%

Tx: max safe resection +/- pre op embolization

If STR, PostOp RT to tumor bed + 5cm margin, to 60-65Gy

If unresectable, Primary RT to 75-90Gy

LC 70-90%

/Spinal Cord tumors

mostly non-high grade gliomas:

astrocytomas (cervical, thoracic),

ependymomas (lumbar)

/Ependymomas- lining of ventricles & central spinal cord

a PNET. Perivascular pseudoRosettes, NF2

MC location: floor of 4th ventricle

Bimodal 5yr, 35yrs

Median age: 3-4yo

Grade:

Grade I-II, WHO II: low grade or differentiated

Grade III-IV, WHO III: anaplastic

Sx: HA, malaise, early AM vomiting (from increased intracranial pressure lying down)

Tests:

MRI (5-10% don't enhance)

PreOp SpineMRI, CSF.  Or, have to wait at least 15 days postop.

Always audiology, neurocog testing, growth measurements.

CSF relapse risk: 5-15%. (less than medullo, which is up to 30%)

5% if supratentorial

5% if low grade infratentorial

10-15% if high grade infratentorial

Check CSF no sooner than 15 days after resection to avoid false positives.

Poor Prognostic Factors: (Merchant, St. Jude’s Phase II trial)

 extent of resection (less than GTR),

 anaplastic grade,

 age <3

If age<4, try chemo (platinum, cytoxan) first, delay RT when possible.

Rx: Maximum Safe Resection, then postop brain MRI, then

If –CSF,

 If GTR: observe if supratentorial AND low grade (myxopapillary ependymoma- filum terminale) ACNS0121 study ongoing, o/w limited field RT to 59.40 Gy

 If STR: limited field RT to 59.4Gy.

If +CSF, CSI 36, boost gross spine dz only to 50Gy.

Limited field is postop tumor bed/ residual + 1.5cm margin.

RT Toxicities: neurocognitive difficulties (ST memory, attention), growth hormone defic, temporal lobes (hippocampus), cochlea (not so much)<40Gy, secondary malignancies lifetime risk 2-3%.

5yr DFS ~50%

Usually recurrence is local.

LG 5yOS 60-80%

HG 5yOS 10-40%

*Adjuvant RT always prolongs survival! Improve 5yr OS from 13-23% to 45-63%

No role for adjuvant chemo in ependymoma (unless age<2-3).

25% may be cured w/ surgery alone

low grade myxopapillary is most likely in filum terminale. Rx w/ surgery.

Glen Stevens, neuro-oncologist from CC

Need post-op MRI within 48h so less post-op artifacts, can see residual tumor better

steroids

 Dex 4q6 is most common dose, dose earlier in the day

 need H2 blocker

 may need Bactrim prophy if >1 mo on steroids

 interacts with Dilantin

can treat radionecrosis w/ Avastin (decreases edema, but lots of side effects)

anti-convulsants

 tumors around motor strip more likely to cause sz

Minesh Mehta, going to be director of protons @ U of Maryland starting Oct 2012

WBI Talk:

Hard to change OS in Brain Mets.

PCI in NSCLC

at least 5 trials

Taken together: 67% risk reduction for developing new brain mets.

For gross brain met pts, Tumor Remission over time:

WBI keeps tumors at bay 30-40% up to 9 mos out.

MGd, NSCLC trial: Time to neuro progression improved in MGd arm.

MGd helped WBI achieve this.

Responders do better than non-responders.

Uncontrolled disease is bad for the brain.

(What does this really prove??)

Local + WBI always reduces brain disease better than Local alone (S or SRS).

What about the balance between neurocognitive decline from the WBI vs from the tumors:

Memory is most susceptible to decline, earliest toxicity.

Try a radioprotector:

NMD receptor agonist (Memantine) RTOG 0614  (ASTRO 2012, SNO 2012)

intranasal insulin

ACE Inhibitor

/memantine

The target dose of memantine is 10 mg orally twice daily for the treatment of Alzheimer’s dementia. To reduce adverse effects, it is often started at a dose of 5 mg daily and increased by 5 mg every week to the target dose. The dose should be capped at 5 mg orally twice daily for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance, 5 mL/min-29 mL/min). It is available as tablets of 5 mg and 10 mg, as well as an oral solution.

Memantine is generally well tolerated. In studies of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, the most common adverse effects were dizziness, headache, constipation, somnolence, hypertension, vomiting and abnormal gait. 

/RTOG 0614

554 pts

 WBRT (37.5 Gy in 15 fractions)

Patients were randomized to receive placebo or memantine

Memantine was administered as an oral pill: 20 mg/day for 24 weeks and started within 3 days of initiating radiotherapy. All patients were to continue the medication for 24 weeks despite progressive disease

Standardized tests of cognitive function were performed at baseline, 8, 16, 24 and 52 weeks

Memantine reduces the decline in memory at 24 weeks (though this not statistically significant, this endpoint was likely underpowered)

Memantine reduces the relative risk of cognitive decline, which was maintained even after memantine was discontinued (at 6-9 months)

Memantine delays the time to cognitive decline and reduces decline in memory, cognitive, executive and global function, as well as processing speed.

In summary, memantine helps to preserve cognitive function after WBRT in patients with brain metastases

Doses <3Gy can affect memory.

...Mehta, ASTRO 2011, Red 2012(?)

7-12Gy to bilateral Hippocampi can cause measurable neurocognitive (short term memory) decline.

Using IMRT, 5mm margin around bilateral hippocampi

(only 2% of whole brain volume)

But will pts fail in this region of brain?

Risk of peri-hippocampal failure is low (<10%?)

DEBATE: SRS+-WBI

Eric Chang vs John Suh

AGAINST:

Eric Chang, USC

MRI can detect new DBF before Sx.

Not true that WBI eventually inevitable, especially for melanoma.

No decrement in OS with delayed WBI.

Chemo can be given sooner.

Chang says no to WBI if 1-3 mets.

Chang says yes to WBI if 10+ mets.

FOR:

John Suh, CC

He's quoting Patchell 2.

HVLT, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, nadir at 3 mo but then actually improves!?...

Increased risk of radionecrosis w/ repeated SRS.

Increased costs of surveillance and repeated SRS.

=====

DEBATE: S + (SRT vs WBI)

Minesh Mehta vs Scott Soltys

Mehta: WBI

S never a true oncologic resection.

Can be local, leptomeningeal, DBF.

Need something.

Kalakota, in press, Northwestern

S+SRS

good KPS

by 12-14mo, 31.6% mortality

Aoyama Red 2007: WBI gave better freedom from 3pt drop in MMSE (crude test).

No Level I evidence for local cavity SRT.

There are other dimensions of neurocognition that were not measured.

White matter changes may not lead to neurocognitive deficits.

Soltys: cavity SRS only

Cavity SRS can use higher doses:

 Roberge Red 2009 and Choi Red 2012 show higher 2yr LC of >80-90%, which is better than the LC from post-op WBI

Other options fro some: NSCLC w/ EGFR (Park, Lung CA 2012),

  and Her2+ breast CA, LANDSCAPE trial ASCO 2011 Lapatanib/Xeloda(?)

Caveat: Leptomeningeal Disease risk: if this is high risk, like in posterior fossa tumors or piecemeal resection, may need to do WBI.

=====

DEBATE S vs SRS

Sawaya: S

prolonged need for steroids after SRS

<1.5cm tumors are not in debate -> do SRS

Michael Vogelbaum: SRS

better for...

<2cm tumors

deep

functional areas

multiple mets

prior WBI

recurrence

Surgical risks: infection, bleeding, DVT, cardiac (after herceptin), may delay chemo

Debatable situations:

2-4cm mets (SRS LC is inferior for >2cm lesions)

Need some form of adjuvant therapy: WBI, cavity SRS, chemo, gliasite (high rate of necrosis), gliadel trial 23% LR rate, probably won't pass muster.
