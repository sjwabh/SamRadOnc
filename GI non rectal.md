//COLON CA
From NCCN 3.2021:
PRE OP:
Neoadjuv Consider chemoRT 45-50Gy for initially unresectable or med inoperable non-metastatic T4 colon CA to aid resectability.


From NCCN 3.2021:
POST OP:
Consider radiation treatment for T4 with penetration to a fixed structure after surgery.





colon does NOT have better prognosis than rectum (stage for stage) even tho easier for colon to be completely resected.

Screening colonoscopy guidelines from ACG: 10 years starting at age 50 years still stands with one modification: screening should begin at age 45 for African American men.

/FAP - Familial Adenomatous POLYP -osis:  /APC gene on chr5, 5 letters in polyp.

100% will get colonCA.  Start screening at puberty!

Also need upper endoscopy, cuz increased risk of upper GI malignancies?

Left-sided colon.

/HNPCC (5% of all colonCA) /Lynch I,II Syndrome - mismatch repair.  inherited as AD.  

Lifetime Risk of CRC: 70-80%

Start screening at age 21-25.

Doesn't need upper endoscopy.

Right-sided colon.

Also Uterine, Ovarian CA.

Two forms of hereditary colon cancer include the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) syndrome associated with hundreds of polyps carpeting the entire colon and often left-handed disease. In the attenuated form (AFAP), however, there may be 20-100 polyps and a slightly older age of onset.

The other hereditary form of colon cancer is the hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome. In Lynch syndrome, the lifetime risk for colon cancer is about 70-80%, often before age 50, with less than 20 polyps in affected individuals and a tendency toward right-sided tumors and additional cancers. Uterine cancer is also seen in Lynch syndrome, with women having a 40-60% lifetime risk for the disease. Other associated cancers include ovarian cancer (up to 12% lifetime risk) and cancers of the small bowel, hepatobiliary, and GU system (less than 10% lifetime risk). In addition, glioblastoma may occasionally occur in HNPCC (1-3% lifetime risk) and is referred to as Turcot syndrome and sebaceous neoplasms may occur and is referred to as Muir-Torre syndrome.

MISMATCH REPAIR (MMR) PROTEIN EVALUATION BY IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY:

- MLH1 NUCLEAR EXPRESSION: INTACT

- MSH2 NUCLEAR EXPRESSION: ABSENT

- MSH6 NUCLEAR EXPRESSION: ABSENT

- PMS2 NUCLEAR EXPRESSION: INTACT

INTERPRETATION:

- POSITIVE FOR MMR PROTEIN DEFICIENCY

- CONSISTENT WITH MICROSATELLITE INSTABILITY (MSI)

- LYNCH SYNDOME NOT EXCLUDED

RECOMMENDATION:

- GENETIC COUNSELING CONSULTATION RECOMMENDED

Mismatch repair proteins are the products of four genes responsible for DNA

mismatch repair. Inactivation of these genes may occur by germline mutation

(i.e. Lynch Syndrome) or sporadic inactivation. Loss of gene expression

has a high sensitivity (90-95%) and specificity (100%) for the detection of

microsatellite unstable cancers (MSI). Intact protein expression

essentially excludes microsatellite unstable tumors or Lynch Syndrome.

However, intact protein expression does not exclude all types of hereditary

cancer. If a strong family history of colorectal or other malignancies is

present, genetic counseling may be indicated. Positive BRAF mutation

analysis (if performed) is indicative of sporadic inactivation and

virtually excludes Lynch Syndrome. Salem Cancer Institute genetic

counseling may be contacted at 503-562-4321.

MLH1 Promoter Hypermethylation Not Detected

Interpretation: Approximately 15% of colorectal tumors which display

microsatellite instability (MSI) are due to hereditary causes such as Lynch

syndrome (HNPCC). MLH1 promoter methylation and gene silencing is the

primary cause of microsatellite instability in sporadic endometrial

cancers. More commonly, MSI is a result of somatic MLH1 promoter

hypermethylation1. In an effort to differentiate between hereditary and

somatic causes of MSI related to MLH1, the methylation status of the MLH1

promoter can be ascertained; if hypermethylated then the cause is likely

not due to a hereditary mutation.

MLH1 promoter hypermethylation was not detected in this individual in DNA

extracted from the tumor sample (M15-7166-1I) which was determined to be

20% tumor by our pathology review. These results indicate that MSI is

not likely to be a result of somatic MLH1 promoter hypermethylation.

Genetic counseling is recommended.

 

/Gardner's Syndrome: FAP+DESMOIDS w/ extracolonic manifestations: intra-abdominal desmoid (abd pain), osteomas (jaw), epidermoid cysts.

/Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome: AD, benign Jejunal polyps (hamartomas), BUT 15x incr CA risk

  Sx: mucocutaneous splotchy melanocytic macules -> hyperpigmentation

/Turcot's - Brain tumor-polyposis syndrome, or Glioma-polyposis syndrome

association between FAP or HNPCC and brain tumors like medulloblastoma, GBM.

Trifluridine/tipiracil is a combination drug for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. It is a combination of two active pharmaceutical ingredients: trifluridine, a nucleoside analog, and tipiracil, a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor. Wikipedia

From the Package Insert: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-taiFYDrmNjMmhoSkc0WnFDZ00

Radiotherapy There was a slightly higher incidence of overall haematological and myelosuppression-related adverse reactions for patients who received prior radiotherapy compared to patients without prior radiotherapy in RECOURSE (54.6% versus 49.2%, respectively), of note febrile neutropenia was higher in Lonsurf-treated patients who received prior radiotherapy vs. those that did not.
