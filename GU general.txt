Leydig cells (radioresistant): testosterone

Sertoli cells (radioresistant): support and are involved in the differentiation/maturation of spermatozoa

 R testis goes to IVC, may crossover to PA.

 L goes to L renal vein, does NOT crossover.

 Rare iliac involvement.

Easy to salvage failures w/ chemotherapy or XRT. (PMH study: Leung E, Chung P, Panzarella, et al. Total treatment Burden in stage I seminoma patients. J Clin Oncol. 2010;28(15S):350s.)

Principles of RT:

Start < 7 wks from surgery.

Counter-argument for RT for Stage I seminoma:

High rate of RT secondary malignancies:

Travis et al. (4) combined 14 population-based registries that included 10 534 patients with seminoma (all stages) treated with radiation therapy and estimated that for a 35-year-old patient with seminoma, the cumulative 40-year risk of a second malignancy if treated with radiation therapy was 36% compared with 23% in the normal population.

Another study: 2.6x increase in 2nd malignancies.

2-4x incr risk of cardiac events after infradiaphragmatic RT.

Para Aortic Field:

NCCN and Kuban (MDACC) only goes up to T12 to L5 for ParaAo.  10 cm wide.

/NSGCT Treatment

Less role for PostOp XRT than Seminomas.

Stage I: orchiectomy alone, consider prophy chemo if high-risk.

Recurrence risk is 25% for NSGCT.

Consider RPLND for Stage I or II.

Chemo for GCTs

Historically, PVB - platinum, vinblastine, bleomycin

But now BEP equivalent & etopo less toxic.

/BEP (/BEC) (Bleo, Etoposide, CisPlatin)

BEPx3 remains standard for good risk disseminated GCTs, 90% cured in 9 wks

//Bladder CA

/Urothelial (formerly called transitional cell) carcinoma is the predominant histologic type in the United States and Europe, where it accounts for approximately 90 percent of all bladder cancers


Risk: men, 60-70 yo, smoking, recurrent UTIs, pelvic RT, schisto (SCC), aniline dye, hair dye, textile/rubber/leather/painter, phenacetin

Workup:

CBC, Chemo w/ LFT, Alk Phos
office cystoscopy w/ cytology
upper collecting system imaging: Renal US, CT urogram, MRI urogram, or IVP
If muscle invasive, then more WORKUP:
CT abd/ pelvis* –for bladder wall thickening, LNs, hydronephrosis, liver mets,
always get CT or MRI if muscle invasion or upper tract
MRI pelvis – better at defining extravesicular tumor extent

Lymph Drainage:

Regional LNs are in the true pelvis.

Common iliacs is considered M+.

Risk of LNs is Tx10% (T1=10%, T2=20%, etc..)

distant mets go to LNs > lung > bone and liver

Prognostic Factors: depth of invasion, high grade, size>5cm, ALI, +N, sessile (flat), ureteral obstruction/ hydronephrosis,






TREATMENT:

For Ta, Tis, T1:
TURBT alone: 30% recurrence
TURBT + intravesicular BCG x 6 wks: 70% LC @ 1yr, 60% @ 5yrs (50% ultimately fail even w/ BCG)

T2:
outcome after aggressive TURBT + concurrent chemo/RT: 

Treatment Options:
Radical Cystectomy (start w/ pelvic LND (common, ii, ei, obturators), if LN-, then bladder, urethra, prostate & SV, vas deferens, ant vagina wall, TAH/BSO)
Partial Cystectomy (<2cm unifocal dome tumors without CIS)


Bladder-sparing (TURBT+ChemoRT).

Chemo: MMC, Cis, BCG, Gemzar, MVAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin, and cisplatin), GC (gem-cisplatin) better than MVAC

CR rate after 39.6 Gy:

T2 71%

T3-4a 57%

65% retain their bladder

T2 – 60% retain bladder at 5 years

T3-4 35% retain bladder at 5 years

Concurrent Chemo: Cisplatin 70-100mg/m2 q3wks for bladder-sparing.

(RTOG trial showed MVC didn’t help and increased toxicity)

or weekly cisplatin.

Dome are harder to treat.

Dome and anterior move the most.

Bladder-sparing CRT:

No randomized trials have been completed comparing radical cystectomy vs. bladder preservation.

Criteria for bladder-sparing ChemoRT:

predominantly urothelial histology

 unifocal muscle-invasive T2-T3a <5cm with no CIS

 no visible tumor after TURBT

 adequate bladder fcn (no incontinence)

 adequate renal fcn (for cisplatin)

 no hydronephrosis (involves ureteral orifices, can't do TURBT if involves ureteral orifices, only 35% have CR)

 No LN involvement. (5yr OS 30% if N+)

No extensive CIS

Cons: cost, Long FU, 3 specialties required, newer surgeries

For bladder-sparing approach, always do maximal TURBT first, mapping, bx of prostatic urethra and trigone(?). Those who get a complete TURBT do better.






From UpToDate 4/2022:


●The authors' general approach is to give approximately 40 to 45 Gy to the entire bladder, prostatic or proximal urethra, and the adjacent lymph node basin in the pelvis. An additional boost to 10 to 15 Gy is then given to the entire bladder, and a further 10 Gy is given to the tumor, for a total tumor dose of 64 to 65 Gy.

●In patients who are candidates for cystectomy, an alternative approach, known as "split-course chemoradiation" may be offered. In this approach, a restaging cystoscopy with repeat TURBT and biopsies may be obtained following the initial 40 to 45 Gy of radiation (induction course), and if a patient has a complete response or has only Ta or Tis residual disease that can be managed intravesically, consolidation concurrent chemoradiation is continued to the total dose of 64 to 65 Gy (algorithm 1). We most commonly administer a continuous course of chemoradiation to full dose without treatment break, although there are limited data demonstrating superiority of this approach over split-course chemoradiation.

●Other groups, including those in the United Kingdom (UK), treat only the bladder (without a pelvic nodal field), to a total dose of 64 Gy in 2 Gy daily fractions. This is then followed by restaging cystoscopy.


A pooled analysis of four prospective Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trials evaluated 157 patients who underwent bladder-preserving TMT and survived at least two years with their bladder intact [65]. With a median follow-up of 5.4 years, 6 percent of patients experienced late (≥180 days after start of consolidation therapy) grade ≥3 genitourinary toxicity, and 2 percent experienced grade ≥3 gastrointestinal toxicity. 

●A patient-reported quality of life and urodynamics study of long-term survivors of bladder-preserving TMT showed that 75 percent of patients had normally functioning bladders [66]. Six percent of patients reported difficulty with urinary flow, 15 percent with urinary urgency, 19 percent with incontinence, and 22 percent with bowel symptoms. Among men, 36 percent reported normal erections, and another 18 percent noted weaker erections that were still sufficient for intercourse.

●A study of 226 long-term survivors with muscle-invasive bladder cancer compared patient-reported quality of life in patients treated with TMT versus radical cystectomy [67]. In multivariable analysis, patients who received TMT had significantly better general health-related quality of life than patients who had a radical cystectomy. TMT also had better bowel quality of life and equivalent urinary quality of life compared with radical cystectomy.

However, the patient's baseline urinary function before treatment is an important consideration, since patients with very poor baseline urinary function may not have a "bladder worth sparing."

This part of the 2x2 trial closed early due to slow accrual.
Low overall rate of late toxicities. Everyone did well. Didn't see less toxicity in the reduced volume group.
Couldn't quite prove non-inferiority.
Only 12% needed salvage cystectomy.
They didn't treat pelvic nodes.



A meta-analysis of individual patient data from two randomized, phase III studies (BC2001 and BCON) compared two radiotherapy fractionation schedules that are commonly used in treatment of locally advanced bladder cancer, a standard schedule of 64 Gy in 32 fractions over 6.5 weeks and a hyperfractionated schedule of 55 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks.[Choudhury, Lancet Onc 2021] 
This analysis found that the hypofractionated schedule is noninferior to the standard fractionation schedule for both invasive local control and toxicity 
and that the hypofractionated schedule is superior regarding invasive local control.
