Glottic: TVC + anterior commisure

Subglottic - from 5mm below cords to inferior border of cricoid

 

Lymph spread: to ipsi JD, Level III, Level IV, & contra JD.

Suprahyoid epiglottis – does better (dt less lymphatics?)

Infrahyoid epiglottis – does worse dt porous cartilage, hypoxic tumors

 

/Supraglottic Staging

T1: 1 subsite* with normal VC mobility

T2: >1 subsite* or region outside the supraglottis (e.g., vallecula, BOT, medial wall of pyriform sinus) without VC fixation

T3: limited to larynx with VC FIXATION or invades: PPP

 Paraglottic space (sliver of fat between TVC and thyroid cartilage

 Pre-epiglottic space

 Postcricoid area

 minor thyroid cartilage invasion

T4a: TTEST: Trachea, major Thyroid cartilage invasion, Esophagus, Strap muscles, Tongue muscles.

T4b: PCM: Prevertebral space, encases Carotid a, invades Mediastinum

 

(N table for Supraglottic & Glottic)

/SGL Treatment

 

Sx: "hot potato" voice: clipped speech, from supraglottic larynx or BOT invasion

 

T1N0: 1 subsite* with normal VC mobility  (LN risk 15-20%)

 Primary RT: Cover B II, III. 50+16=66Gy, conventional fractionation. MK does opposed lats 225x28=6300.

   Can skip IV, V for T1N0, but JH sometimes covers it.

 JH does this: IMRT, GTV+1cm 220x30=6600, CTV+3mm (II, III) 180x30=5400.

 Or JH does this: IMRT GTV 70Gy in 35, CTV1 63Gy to II, III, CTV2 56Gy to V, IV. No RP.

 

T2N0, T3N0 nonbulky & exophytic: HyperFx or CB. (LN risk >20%??)

  CB: 180x30 to 54Gy, add CB 150x12 to GTV+2cm for last 12 days, total dose 72Gy

  IMRT to B II, III, IV, no RP

 

T2 bulky or infiltrating, or T3 w/ mobile cord:

   SG L +/- post-op RT to 56Gy (lower dt arytenoid edema).

   If Med Inoperable, HyperFx or CB.

 

T3 w/ VC FIXATION or BULKY: (LN risk 20-30%?)  

   Mobile VC: SG L +/- postop RT to 56Gy (dt arytenoid edema).

   Fixed VC: CRT: Cisplatin + IMRT 70-63-56.

 

T4: invades thyroid cartilage, or into soft tissues of the neck, thyroid, or esophagus

  TL + postop RT (IMRT 63-56)

 

 

For SGL,

  Add CHEMO when N1 or fixed VC or BULKY T3

  TL if T4

 

Don't try larynx preservation if:

  tumor bulk >6cc for SGL, hypopharynx; >3cc for glottic

  full thickness thyroid cartilage invasion

 

 

Amdur: You don't need to use IMRT for N0 SGL, cuz below mid-parotid.

 

/SGL OUTCOMES???

the supraclavicular lymph nodes belong to sublevel Vb: the posterior triangle group. This level is bounded:
Superiorly by the horizontal line defined by the lower border of the cricoid cartilage
Inferiorly by the clavicle
Medially (anteriorly) by the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle or sensory branches of cervical plexus
Posteriorly (laterally) by the anterior border of the trapezius muscle




 

Eisbruch Rules:
Include /RP if (OP, HP) AND II-IV involved. (in cases of early lateralized OP
tumors with small N1 disease, treat RP ipsilaterally). (JH says ALWAYS include RP for all pharyngeal cancers.)
Always add IV and IB if levels II or III are positive.
Always add V if II-IV are involved.

In other words,
  if II or III involved, add IB, IV, V.
  if IV involved, add V.

• Primary end point = overall survival, secondary 

endpoint = disease-free survival

• At 3 years, END improved overall survival (80.0%), as 

compared with therapeutic dissection (67.5%) (HR for

Anatomy: /Wharton's duct is the submandibular duct.

Tx:

Early T1 or T2: Surgery preferred, cuz risk of soft tissue or bone necrosis after RT.

Moderately advanced anterior midline: Surgery + B ND.

 

Surgery: "Rim resection" or Mandibulectomy

 

The CTV includes the genioglossus

and geniohyoid muscles bilaterally,

the sublingual and submandibular salivary

glands ipsilaterally (bilaterally if

midline tumor), the adjoining alveolar

ridge and mandible, and the muscles at the

•       surgery and adjuvant irradiation provides superior results over radical irradiation and is recommended

•       even if margins are negative, adjuvant irradiation is recommended for almost all patients

•       avoid using high-energy electrons for the anterior portal – due to inhomogeneity of facial contours and the presence of air cavities, inadvertent overdosage of the optic nerves may occur

M+          66Gy

For low grade, or benign, w/ neg margins: 50-54 Gy.

For high grade, N+: 60Gy if CR, 66Gy for M+

 

Parotid RT Neck Dose: 50Gy.

Ipsi Levels II-IV, maybe IB (if +II), V (if +IIB-IVB).

From RTOG 1008: 

For nodal coverage, ipsilateral level II, III and IV should be included. If there is nodal

involvement in level II, then the ipsilateral retrostyloid space and level IB should also

be included. Ipsilateral level V is included if there is nodal involvement in level IIB, 

IIIB or IVB. The surgical scar should be outlined and also included in CTV50 or

CTV54. 

Prophylactic nodal irradiation for the N0 neck is not mandatory for adenoidcystic carcinomas but should be considered for advanced primary T-category (T3,T4).

Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma: diagnostic difficulty and outcome.

Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg. 2008;138(5):601.

RESULTS: Eight of 24 (33%) CXPAs versus 41 of 300 (14%) PAs were localized in the deep lobe (P<0.05). Forty-two percent of CXPAs versus 6 percent of PAs, respectively, were greater than 4 cm (P<0.05). The sensitivity in detecting CXPA by fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) was 47 percent. The tumor was known to be malignant preoperatively in 10 (42%) patients. Six of 24 (25%) patients with CXPA developed a tumor recurrence. The overall 5-year survival rate of CXPA was 76 percent.

PostOp CRT vs PostOp RT.

60-66Gy, Cisplatin 100mg/m2 q3wks on days 1,22,43

459 pts

Originally: Improved 2yr LRC 82% v 72%, Improved DFS.

No OS diff.

Worse G3 tox 77% v 34% !!

Criticisms: 41% of pts were not really high risk.  Had more OP, they do better.

 

Update ASTRO 2006: "Long-Term Survival Results of a Phase III Intergroup Trial (RTOG 95-01)"

At 5 yrs, no longer statistically significant diffs in LRC, DFS.

Adding chemo to PostOp RT used to give LocoRegional benefit, but not anymore.

In subset analysis: +M, +ECE, were still significant.

Improved 5yr OS 53% v 40%.

Improved 5yr PFS 47% v 36%.

Improved 5yr LRR 18 v 31%.

But worse G3 toxicities 41% v 21%.

 

 

COMPARISON:

RTOG had more OP, they do better.

EORTC had more hypopharynx.

 

RTOG had more N2+ (94% v 57%).

 

EORTC got higher dose (91% got 66Gy). 

In RTOG only 13% got 66Gy.

 

 

 

In Bernier pooled analysis, H&N 2005;27:843-850 "DOI: 10.1002/hed.20279"

Only pts w/ +ECE and/or +M had better OS with CRT.

 

So adding postop chemo to postop RT is of questionable benefit for:

PMID: 25002723

Compared to historical controls (9501) absolute improvement in 2-year DFS of 2.5% and 11.1%, for cis and docetaxel arms, respectively.

Results from RTOG 0234 demonstrated a decreased rate of distant metastatic disease in patients receiving docetaxel chemotherapy rather than standard cisplatin chemotherapy. This hypothesis is being further tested in high-risk postoperative patients in RTOG 1216,

RTOG 9615, Phase II for IA cis for H&N, looked promising.

Dutch Phase III trial (Rasch, ASTRO 2006):

No diff in locoregional control w/ short median FU 20 mos.

Criticism: Dutch used bilateral IA infusion for tumors that minimally crossed midline.  Robbins says should favor unilateral infusion to bulk of tumor 80-90% of time, & he still thinks there may be some advantages to IA (lower toxicity (N/V, renal), especially for neoadjuvant polychemotherapy.

T3    >4cm  or    fixation of hemilarynx

T4a   invades thyroid cartilage, cricoid, Soft tissues, Esophagus, Thyroid gland, Hyoid Bone

T4b   PCM: prevertebral fascia, encases Carotid, Mediastinum

 

The CTV therefore includes the parapharyngeal tissue cranially through the nasopharynx and caudally 2 cm below the cricoid cartilage. The posterior pharyngeal wall and ipsilateral hemilarynx are included for pyriform sinus and lateral pharyngeal wall cancer. The ipsilateral thyroid lobe is included in cases of pyriform sinus cancer extending laterally.

The role of human papilloma virus (HPV) in cancers of the hypopharynx is unclear, although it may play more of a role in cancers of the oropharynx and oral cavity. Nonsmokers with cancers of the head and neck are more likely to have detectable HPV, although this is less common than hypopharyngeal cancer in persons who smoke.

Conclusions: Larynx preservation with induction chemo is a viable option to total pharyngolaryngectomy in patients with locally advanced hypopharyngeal cancer, with comparable OS & DFS and preservation of a functional larynx in one third of cases.  Those who did not respond to chemo did not suffer decreased survival rates by surgical delay. No pt with stage T4 had a CR with chemo, so don't even try this for T4.

/HN Toxicities:

/HN, general principles of H&N RT

odynophagia: takes 3 wks to resolve after RT finishes.

dysgeusia (taste changes): lasts 4 months after RT finishes.

xerostomia - may be permanent (pilocarpine, lemon drops, water)

dental- 1% fluoride trays

thyroid dysfunction, TFT, (check TSH q6mo x 5yrs, then annually)

secondary malignancies

 

 

 

//Thyroid CA

Types:

 

 From Follicular cells

  Papillary (MC)(good, 20yr DSS 97%!) (multifocal, pre-pubertal (<20yo) RT-induced w/ 10 yr latency, MC

     PSaMMoma bodies, Orphan Annie nuclei), high LN involvement.

  Follicular 20yr DSS 95%! (take up Iodine, but Iodine insuff) vascular invasion, mets to lung,bones.

     Hurthle Cell - variant of follicular, worse prognosis

  Anaplastic 1yr DSS 25% (elderly) = Stage IV


 From C cells

  MTC (10yr DSS 70%)- Calcitonin & ACTH, MEN II, III, Calcitonin can be cvt into amyloid.  MTC doesn’t respond well to either I-131 or EBRT!


Clinical: palpable nodule: DDx: adenoma, colloid cysts

5-10% of thyroid nodules are malignant.
<5% of hot nodules are malignant.
15% of solitary cold nodules are malignant (the majority are adenomas or colloid cysts)
multiple cold nodules are probably multinodular goiter

If h/o childhood XRT, 33% of nodules are malignant.
More likely to be malignant if: solitary, non-tender
Risk Factors: age>45, male, tumor >1.5cm

The characteristics indicating an increased risk for thyroid malignancy are as follows:

Family history of thyroid cancer

Exposure of the neck to radiation that may be therapeutic (e.g., radiation therapy to the neck for lymphoma, etc.); intentional but misguided radiation (e.g., radiation to shrink the thymus in a neonate, as was the practice in the 1950s); nuclear fallout (thyroid cancer is a major problem in the regions affected by Chernobyl)

Pain in the anterior neck
Dysphagia
Symptoms of respiratory obstruction
New nodule in someone < 20 or > 60 years of age
Vocal cord paralysis (hoarseness)
Thyroid nodule that is firm, fixed, and/or growing
Thyroid nodule accompanied by regional cervical lymphadenopathy or Horner syndrome
 
adult thyroid (>20 yo) is not very sensitive to RT-induced secondary malignancies.

Tests: TFTs, ultrasound, FNA preferred over radionuclide uptake scan (I-131 imaging), laryngoscopy (VC paralysis?), calcitonin for MTC.
 
Staging, Thyroid
T1 <2cm
T2 2-4cm
T3 >4cm, or minimal extrathyroid extension
T4a soft tissue extension
T4b PCM: invades prevertebral fascia, carotid a, mediastinal vessels

N1a Level VI (pretracheal, paratracheal, Delphian)
N1b cervical or superior mediastinal nodes
 
Rx:
subtotal thyroidectomy (lobectomy+isthmus) +/- I-131 ablation for low risk dz
OR
total thyroidectomy


Surgery Risks: recurrent laryngeal n paralysis 1-4%, hypoPTH 5%

 

/I131 I-131 for thyroidCA:

Treatment:

NOT USED for MTC. (Use for Papillary or Follicular only, and only if tumor is I-avid, ie, concentrates Iodine. If not, then use EBRT.)

 

Indications for postop I-131 ablation:

After TT or near-TT for well-diff (papillary or follicular) primary >1-1.5cm.

Purposes:
 1. ablate residual thyroid tissue
 2. remove source of Tg
 3. helps I scanning
 4. decreases tumor recurrence, distant mets, death.

Wait 6 wks after surgery.

Do a diagnostic 5mCi I-131 scan
Do pre-treatment and q6-12mo until 2 neg scans.
Prep: make pt hypothyroid by withholding thyroxine, low Iodine diet, or use rTSH.

After scan, wait 5-7 days, then do I-131 ablation, then scan again in 7-10 days.

I-131 Dose: 100-200 mCi

 
FU: Follow Tg levels after ablation, an elevated level indicates recurrent dz.
Need lifelong thyroxine to suppress Thyrotropin, which can stimulate recurrence.
Repeat diagnostic 5mCi I-131 scans q6-12mo until 2 neg scans.


Toxicities of I-131: sialadenitis, N, bone marrow suppression, radiation pneumonitis/fibrosis of lung mets, leukemia, gastritis, cystitis, bladder CA, oligospermia.


Chemo: Adriamycin

EBRT:
If unresponsive to radioiodine, try hyperfractionated RT + Adriamycin.

Benefit of EBRT was shown in a retrospective study of grossly resected well-diff thyroid CA. Benefit seen for T4N+ papillary thyroid CA. Improved LR and DM. (Farahati, Cancer 1996;77:172

/Thyrogen (thyrotropin alfa for injection) contains a highly purified recombinant form of human thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

 

Thyrogen® (thyrotropin alfa for injection) is indicated for use as an adjunctive treatment for radioiodine ablation of thyroid tissue remnants in patients who have undergone a near-total or total thyroidectomy for well-differentiated thyroid cancer and who do not have evidence of metastatic thyroid cancer.

 

Thyrogen is indicated for use as an adjunctive diagnostic tool for serum thyroglobulin (Tg) testing with or without radioiodine imaging in the follow-up of patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer.

Made with xylitol, a natural sweetener that helps stimulate saliva flow, XyliMelts utilize adhering disc technology to slowly release 550 mg of xylitol, which is most effective when continuously released and lingers in the mouth, especially when used while sleeping when saliva flow is lowest. XyliMelts last for hours, moisturizing and coating the mouth for optimal comfort. The mild mint flavor freshens your breath and the xylitol may reduce the risk of tooth decay.

SalivaMAX is a supersaturated calcium phosphate powder that when dissolved in water, creates a solution with a high concentration of electrolytes similar to that of natural saliva. SalivaMAX is an artificial saliva that is used to relieve acute and chronic symptoms of xerostomia. Supersaturated calcium phosphate rinses have been clinically proven to reduce the symptoms of xerostomia (dry mouth) due to medications, dysfunction of the salivary glands, Sjögren’s syndrome, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment.

/MC1273 was a single-arm phase II trial for HPV-related OPSCC testing clinical outcomes and quality of life with a de-escalated course of radiation therapy following surgery to remove the disease. Patients received two weeks of twice-daily radiation therapy to the oropharynx for a total dose of 30-36 Gray (Gy), a 50 percent reduction of the standard radiation dose of 60-66 Gy. Patients also received two courses of chemotherapy (docetaxel 15 mg/m2), delivered on days one and eight. The 43 patients with extracapsular extension (ECE), a marker of particularly aggressive disease, received an additional, simultaneous radiation boost to the areas with ECE, for a total dose (including primary treatment) of 36 Gy.
