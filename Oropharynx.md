//OP /Oropharynx has 8 subsites:

soft palate & uvula

anterior tonsillar pillar

tonsillar fossa (palatine=faucial)

posterior tonsillar pillar

BOT

vallecula

glossotonsillar sulcus

lateral & posterior pharyngeal wall

 

/p16 /HPV 16,18 in 57% of pts, 50% of nonsmokers

By immunohistochemistry, most HPV-positive HNSCCs show p16 overexpression (Marur et al., 2010) (Fig. 9). The combination of low EGFR and high p16 expression has been shown to highly correlate with better clinical outcome compared with high EGFR expression and low HPV titer or high EGFR and low p16 expression (Kumar et al., 2008). P16 expression in oropharyngeal SCCs has also been associated with longer survival times regardless of HPV status (Lewis et al., 2010).

The best method for HPV detection is still controversial. PCR-based detection of HPV E6 oncogene expression in frozen samples is generally regarded as the gold standard but in situ hybridization is also commonly used. P16 immunohistochemistry could serve as a potential surrogate marker (Marur et al., 2010).

As mentioned above, HPV-positive HNSCCs are typically TP53 wild-type. There also seems to be an inverse relationship between EGFR expression and HPV status.

Palatine arch, palatoglossal arch, faucial arch, faucial pillars: formed by soft palate, anterior tonsillar pillar, glossopalatine sulcus (is the floor)

 

Anatomic Boundaries of OP:

S: soft palate

I: hyoid bone

BOT: from circumvallate papilla to vallecula

 

WORKUP:

H&P: painless neck mass, earache, throat pain

 

Sx:

DOTO

 dysphagia

 odynophagia

 trismus

 otalgia

 

 

 

PE: measure tumor size. measure tongue protrusion (deep tongue muscle invasion). palpate tongue, FOM.

Check for tumor extension to pyriform sinuses since this impacts RT portals.

Check anterior border of tumor relative to bones, teeth, for tumor volumes.

 

Labs: CBC, Chemistries, TFTs.  HPV

Imaging: CT & MRI of neck, chest imaging

 

Dental Eval, feeding tube

 

 

Primary RT for T1, T2, exophytic T3, N0-1.

ChemoRT for infiltrative T3, selected T4, N2-3.

 

Lymph: II -> III -> IV

#1: JD

#2: Retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal

 

Oropharynx goes by size 2-4cm

T1 <2cm

T2 2-4cm

T3 >4cm

OP Treatment:

Amdur: RT should be primary therapy for most OP, except maybe T1N0-1 of ATP or uvula.

 

Standard 2D fields:

S: EAC,

P: behind spinous processes

I: thyroid notch

A: split mandible

 

Off cord, then posterior neck strip.

 

A SCV w/ Larynx block.

 

I: below clavicle heads

Lateral: medial 1/3 of clavicles

 

Amdur:

For OP, cover Levels: II, III, IV, V, and IB

/RP (in front of C1, C2): risk is low for ATP, soft palate, but most people treat.

 

Unilateral RT: Do when you can, best for salivary gland sparing.

When risk of contra nodes <10%.

if no BOT, SP, PPW, look at PMH paper.

 

Techniques:

  photon wedged pair

  Ipsi IMRT (minor advantages: if very superior going beyond auditory canal to cerebellum, also spares cochlea.)

 

 

Amdur: For IMRT, to spare contra parotid, stop contouring above inferior transverse process of C1.

 

 

From latest Gunderson:

Tonsil T1, lateralized T2N0, early N2(?):  Ipsilateral IMRT

Nontonsil: T1, T2, more medial T2 tonsil: Bilateral IMRT

 

N2: chemoRT

 

Amdur says may not need chemo for N1, small N2, in T1-T2.

 

...

 

For T3N0 glottic, just do CB w/ no chemo.

For other HN sites, do chemoRT for T3N0.

For these T2N0, you can do chemoRT:

  T2bN0 NP

  T2N0 Hypopharynx

  T2N0 BOT

 

 

/OP studies

 

/Adelstein, /Adalstein, Intergroup, JCO 2003, "DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2003.01.008"

For Adv H&N: OC, OP, HP, Larynx.  (bad things)

chemoRT (cis) vs RT vs split course chemoRT (5FU / cis) (30Gy + 30-40Gy)

All got adjuv cis / 5FU x 3.

3yr OS benefit to chemoRT. 37% v 27% v 23%

3yr DFS: 51% v 41% v 33%

 

/GORTEC 9401 for OP (/Denis, JCO 2004; /Calais, JNCI 99) "DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2004.08.021"

For III,IV OP  (at least T3 or N1)

ChemoRT vs RT

70Gy

carbo / 5FU

CRT Improved 5yr OS 22% v 16%, p=.05, DFS (27% v 15%), LRC (48% v 25%)

But did not improve DM rate.

CRT Increased acute toxicity.

 

 

Per DEG, 2 other OP studies of RT vs CRT:

Red 2001; 50:1161-1171

Red 2006, 64:983-994

 

 

/Anterior Tonsillar Pillar (should be part of Oral cavity)

Exophytic has less lymphatic supply so

Doesn't go to contralat or posterior cervical LN as often.

Only 15% occult nodes

T1-T2, selected T3: primary RT.

Larger tumors: chemoRT or Surgery+RT.

 

Only need Unilateral Neck:

For ipsi neck, use e:p 4:1.

18e- electrons

Dose: 66-70.4Gy

Borders:

 S: pterygoid

 A: 2cm anterior to tumor

 P: mastoid (N0), spinous processes (N+)

 I: arytenoids

 

/Tonsillar Fossa

75% present at advanced Stage III,IV

60-70% LN +

Black Males

 

 

Primary RT 66-72Gy for T1, T2, exophytic T3, N0 to N1.

Add ChemoRT for infiltrative T3, or T4 or (N2-3, or even N1).

Salvage neck dissection after 6 wks.

 

/Tonsil Tx (modified from Ang)

 

T1, superficial T2, N0:       50+16=66Gy, ipsi neck II, III, upper IV?, w/ wedged pair. (w/ matching anterior low neck field?)

 

Large T2 or T3, N0-1:         CB: 54/1.8 + 18/1.5 (last 12 days) = 72Gy

                              B neck. IMRT. II, III, IV, RP.

 

Exophytic T3 & T4, or N2-3:   ChemoRT 70-63-56

 

T4 w/ bone invasion: surgery, then PostOp RT, maybe CRT.

 

For more advanced tonsil (larger T2, exophytic T3) either ChemoRT, OR Surgery+RT.

 

Remember that for T1-2 N1 Tonsil, you better do CB if RT alone (9003), OR add chemo.

Boost field: tumor + 2 cm.

 

JH Dose for locally advanced tonsil for ChemoRT (RTOG 0522):

IMRT 70Gy at 6 fx/week.

 

 

 

IPSI vs BILATERAL Neck:

 

JH and DH says up to 30% contralateral risk if N+ (reference??) so he always does B neck. Often goes to bilateral posterior cervical.

 

To reduce RT-induced xerostomia, trend is now to just do ipsi neck for T1, early T2, N0-1 at MDACC.  Even for T2N1 !!

 

 

Can do ipsi neck up to T2N1.

 

3 papers on ipsi neck for tonsil:

 

Per /O'Sullivan at PMH:

/OSullivan, /PMH Princess Margaret Hospital, Red 2001, "S0360-3016(01)01613"

For 228pts w/ T1-T2N0-1 tonsil. Allowed 1cm of BOT/SP invasion, but not within 1cm of midline.

3yr LC rate was 77%.  Opposite neck failure was seen in 3.5% (but this is only 8 pts!).

 (T1 0%, T2 3%, T3 10%, N1 14.4%)

 

To do ipsi neck only, you have to do a wedged pair. 

Amdur says for OP, salivary preservation is the only indication for IMRT.

But Amdur says you can say IMRT for ipsi neck to spare cochlea and cerebellum for NPC.

 

 

Describe /Wedged Pair technique:

A: 2nd molar (2cm anterior to tumor) (or more anter if cover submand n)

P: 2cm behind mastoid (N0), or behind C2 spinous processes (N+)

S: insertion of medial pterygoid muscle at pterygoid plate.

I: arytenoid

 

Wedge angle = 90 - Hinge/2

Hyperextend chin to avoid exit dose through contralateral orbit.

 

include Levels II,III,IV, V, SCV, RP.

 

The CTV includes the adjacent buccal mucosa, palate, and base of tongue.

In advanced cases, the mandibular bone, the ipsilateral pterygoid muscles, parapharyngeal space, and adjacent nasopharynx are included. When the posterior tonsillar pillars are involved, the CTV extends inferiorly to include the pharyngoepiglottic fold.

 

 

/Posterior tonsillar pillar

 

/soft palate /SP

Sx: erythroplakia (Queyrat's erythroplasia - red velvety)

Nodes: B JD. Midline structure.

Responds well to radiation.

Most are superficial.

Primary RT or CRT preferred, surgery not good cuz: hard to get clear magins, palatal incompetence. Also, since midline structure, would have to do B ND.

 

Primary RT for T1, T2, exophytic T3, N0-N1.

ChemoRT for T3-4, N2-3.

 

Setup: opposed lats +/- A SCV

Dose:

 T1N0: 50+16=66 Gy

 T2, exophytic T3, N0-1: 54/1.8 + CB 15-18/1.5 last 2 wks

 Exophytic T3, T4, N2-3: ChemoRT (cisplatin 100 mg/m2) + 50+20=70Gy.

 

Borders:

 S: 1.5cm above soft palate

 I: arytenoids

 A: 2cm anterior to tumor

 P: mastoid tip (N0),  spinous processes (N+)

 

The CTV includes the

entire soft palate, the superior aspect of

the tonsillar pillars and fossa, as well as the

pterygopalatine fossa. In advanced lesions,

the adjacent nasopharynx and pterygoid

muscles are also included.

 

 

/BOT /Base of Tongue

Primary RT for T1, T2, exophytic T3, N0-N1.                                                 

(any role for chemo? cetux?)

 

For more advanced BOT, surgery + PORT. Probably need laryngectomy to prevent aspiration.

Surgery yields better LC.

OR, ChemoRT (per GORTEC)

 

BOT Fields:

Always bilateral neck for BOT since midline structure.

Always retropharyngeal nodes.

Spare the larynx (30Gy, 20Gy mean dose).

 

Levels: Bilateral V,II,III,IV ?

 

The entire base of tongue,

the vallecula, and generous portions of the

oral tongue should be included in the CTV

(at least 2-cm margins beyond the GTV). If

the vallecula is involved, the suprahyoid

epiglottic larynx is included.

 

 

Ang Doses:

T1N0: 50+16Gy

T2, exophytic T3, N0 or N1: concommitant boost:

54/1.8, + boost 15 to 18 in 1.5 during last 2 wks.

Total 69-72 Gy.

 

Conventional RT Borders:

S: include upper jugular LNs

I: arytenoids

A: 2cm beyond tumor

P: behind spinous processes

 

/OP wall, posterior & lateral

 

extensive submucosal spread.

Lymph: along pharyngeal wall, can go to posterior cervical.

 

Primary RT for T1, T2, exophytic T3, N0-N1.

ChemoRT for T3-4, N2-3.

 

Setup: opposed lats +/- A SCV

Dose: same as tonsillar fossa

 

T1, superficial T2, N0: 50+16=66Gy.

Large T2 or T3, N0-1: 54/1.8 + CB 15-18 /1.5 = 69-72 Gy.

Exophytic T3 & T4, N2-3: ChemoRT 50+20=70Gy.

 

Borders:

S: base of skull to cover parapharyngeal nodes

I: generous, 3cm or more

A: 2cm beyond tumor

P: behind spinous processes

 

//Salvage Neck Dissection after chemoRT

Wait 2 mos to eval and do ND.  (More difficult if wait too long after chemoRT?)

 

/Brizel, Red 2004 Apr 1;58(5):1418

Need for ND after chemoRT.

 

/Roy, H&N 2002 May;24(5):474

36pts

<cCR: 66% were path+

cCR: 33% were path+

 

 

If N1, cCR -> likely pCR

If N1, <cCR -> likely path+

If N1, accuracy of clinical exam: 90% for detecting path+.

 

If N2-N3, accuracy of clinical exam ~60%. imaging may not be that much better.  Should we just do a ND on everyone with N2N3?

 

Imaging to figure out who needs ND:

 

CT: good at finding disease if present.  Not so good at ruling out.

/Ojiri, AJNR 2002 11-12;23(10);1627

If CT shrinkage >40%, predicts pathCR.

If CT shrinkage ~25%, predicts path+.

 

PET:

 

/Rogers, Red 2004 Mar 1;58(3):694

12pts

PET 1 mo after RT, then ND

PET: sensitivity 45%, specificity 100%, ppv 100%

Question: timing of PET

 

 

Pete A: FU at 1 mo after chemoRT. If Clinical exam +, then plan for "super selective ND" at 2 mo out.  Even if node shrinks, if still palpable at 2 mo, he still does ND (no imaging).  If not palpable, then if PET- then no ND, if PET+ then ND.

Do PET at 3 mos out.

 

What about needle bx of treated palpable node?  Hard to interpret if negative or only "suspicious".

 

What about upfront when you have to take them to the OR for tissue or "excisional bx" for diagnosis, should you just go ahead and take out the gross disease to save them from needing a salvage ND (1/3 need this anyway)?  Debatable.

 

Robotic Assisted OP surgery: PeteA says most will need post-op RT, but the value may be in avoiding post-op chemo.
