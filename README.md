## About Me

- I am currently an undergraduate senior pursuing a dual bachelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science with a Robotics minor at Johns Hopkins.
- I am currently applying to graduate school starting Fall 2024 to pursue a PhD in Computer Science / Robotics.
- I have participated in research projects involving VR/AR for medical procedures, VR for teleoperated satellite repair, machine learning for bioinformatics, and robotic navigation systems.
- My current research interests are at the intersection of medical robotics, high performance graphics computing, virtual/augmented reality, and machine learning.
