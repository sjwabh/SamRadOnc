Hx: HIV risk factors

Exam: pelvic exam for females, anoscopy, inguinal LNs

Labs: HIV

Imaging: CT abd/ pelvis, PET, CXR

Incidence: 4600 in 2007.  (same as small bowel CA)

Median age 62

Risks: F>M, rising, genital warts, smoking, ano-receptive intercourse,

 >90% are HPV+!! (16,18,6/11), HSV2, HIV (38x RR for males), immunocompromised

1-2% are melanoma

Dentate Line (pectinate line)

 Above: columnar epithelium (perirectal->superior rectal->IMA->PA, internal iliacs?)

 Below: stratified squamous epithelium (middle/inferior rectal a.->int iliac, or Inguinal/femoral n.)

Anal Canal: above AV.  4cm.

Anal Verge: keratinized. Separates anal canal from anal margin.

Anal Margin (peri-anal skin, hair bearing): (better prognosis)  (inguinal/femoral n. --> ext iliac n -> common iliac n.) -> For small, Tx like skin cancer w/ WLE, For large -> RT.

25-33% of anal tumors are Cloacogenic (no different) carcinomas (also called basaloid or transitional cell carcinomas) are sometimes listed as a subclass of squamous cell cancers. They develop in the transitional zone epithelium, the ring of tissue between the anal canal and the rectum, also called the cloaca. While they look slightly different under the microscope, these cancers behave and are treated like other squamous cell carcinomas.

Anal AdenoCA: 15% of anal tumors are adenoCA! These appear to do worse than SCC, w/ 5yr OS <50%.  Higher risk of distant recurrence and LRR.

Tepper doesn't believe in IMRT for Anal.

If Stage I (T1N0), local excision (if anal margin) or RT alone. (Altho many centers do CRT even for early stage anal.)

Mayo clinic study: 13 pts

• RT alone

indications: poor general health precludes chemo

AIDS with CD4 < 200 (poor tolerance to both chemo and RT – ask medical oncologist opinion)

mini-pelvis with upper field border at lower edge of SI joints + uninvolved inguinal nodes

RT alone for T1-2 N0 disease with 60 Gy has LRC 80%



LC 70-100% for T1-2N0 Anal.

O/W, Definitive CRT

Anal Chemo: Bolus 5FU 1000 mg/m2/d x 4d x 2cycles, mitoC 10mg/m2 x 2 cycles, weeks 1 & 5.

If HIV w/ CD4<200,

make sure they're on HAART (highly active anti retroviral therapy)

try to still use same CRT (may need decrease RT dose by 5%, stop at 50Gy)

Decrease chemo dose, use cis instead of MMC.

RT  vs  Chemo/RT

2 Randomized trials have shown a significant improvement in LRC and DFS with Chemo/RT vs RT alone

• However, No significant OS benefit shown (though some have shown Higher CSS with chemo/RT)

• With Chemo/RT expect approx 30% LRR and DFS around 70%

• Originally, the RT dose with chemotherapy was as low as 30 Gy.  Many of the early RTOG trials and EORTC used 45 Gy.  Now retrospective studies have shown dose-escelation to 55 Gy range

/Anal Doses:

Beaumont Notes:

Primary dose:
50.4 for T1
55.8 for T2-4, may bst to 64.8 if “poor response”

Pelvic dose:

30.6  whole pelvis (L5-S1), then lower sup border to bottom of SI joint to:
36    Inguinal dose, then come off inguinals to:
45 true pelvis (superior border to bottom of SI joint)

Boost to tumor + 2.5cm:
T1-2: 54Gy
T3-4: 55.8-59.4Gy

Inguinal dose: 36-59Gy:

36 Gy for N0

/REVIEW : Tchelebi, CA Can J Clin 2021, is a good recent review of Anal CA







Anal outcomes (Goswitz): LC 70-80%, OS 70-80%

/Anal Follow-Up FU:

After CRT, exam + anoscopy q6wks until cCR, then FU q3mo. May take up to 12 mos to regress.

Devita:

Residual masses after radiation or chemoradiation may take several months to

regress fully. Frequent examination by an experienced observer is desirable, including, if necessary, examination under anesthesia, in order to detect recurrence early and forestall progression to technical unresectability. The development of a hard-edged ulcer after previous healing, an enlarging mass, or increasing pain at the primary tumor site should raise suspicion of recurrence.

Suspected residual cancer should be confirmed by biopsy. Random biopsies from the site of the primary cancer in the absence of clinical features suspicious for cancer in a series of 61 patients were positive in only 2%, and there was a false negative

rate of about 20% (12 of 60). So don't do random biopsies.

 Gunderson LL, Winter KA, Ajani JA, et al. : Long-term update of US GI intergroup RTOG 98-11 phase III trial for anal carcinoma: survival, relapse, and colostomy failure with concurrent chemoradiation involving fluorouracil/mitomycin versus fluorouracil/cisplatin. J Clin Oncol 30:4344–4351, 2012.

In the recent update of RTOG 9811,42 the use of MMC was associated with better disease-free survival (67.8% vs. 57.8% at 5 years, P = .006) and better overall survival (78.3% vs. 70.7% at 5 years, P = .026) when compared to the CDDP arm. There was a trend toward statistical significance for locoregional relapse, colostomy-free survival, and decreased colostomy failure favoring the MMC arm

OLD report: (Ajani, "JAMA. 2008;299(16):1914-1921")

Median FU: 2.5yrs

NO diff 5yr DFS 54-60%, 5yr OS 70-75%.

LC 80-85%?

Mito had better 5yr Colostomy Rate 10% vs 19%, p=.02

So std of care is still mitoC.

Multivariate: gender, nodal status, tumor size (<2.5 v >5)

Moist desq was same,

Worse hematologic toxicities in mitoC.

But worse GI toxicities in platinum arm.???

MitoC/ 5FU/ RT remains standard of care for analCA.

Critiques: mito arm didn't have an induction phase.  Induction phase may be detrimental!

RTOG 9811 confirmed that induction chemotherapy with CDDP and concurrent chemoradiation is inferior to up-front concurrent chemoradiation with MMC. The use of induction in the CDDP arm, however, is a potential confounder. The ACT II trial in the United Kingdom added to the debate by making a direct comparison of CDDP to MMC in the concurrent chemoradiation-alone setting. Preliminary data with a median follow-up of 5 years presented at the 2012 American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting suggest an equivalence between radiation with 5-FU and MMC and radiation with 5-FU and CDDP.43 Based on the current evidence, it has been concluded that concurrent chemoradiation with 5-FU and MMC remains the standard of care

Two randomizations:

i) MMC- vs CIS- chemoRT.

Conclusion:

i) No diff in CR, RFS, OS between MMC vs CIS, or +/- maintenance 5FU-cis.

Higher G3-4 heme toxicities in MMC arm, but no increase in neutropenic sepsis.

No diff in colostomy rate.

They conclude that MMC-5FU remains std of care.

Low risk of inguinal nodal failure of 1-2% (?).

ACT2, ASCO 2009

2 questions: MMC vs Cis, maint chemo?

Conclusion:

No diff between MMC vs Cis, and worse hematologic toxicity in MMC (but what about colostomy rate?)

Maint chemo doesn't help.

(So why do we still like MMC better?  CRT says we may still be able to make a case for CIS instead of MMC)

Timing of CR in ACT II:

11        58-65%

18        75-77%

/IMRT Anal

Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy vs. 3D Conformal Radiation Therapy for Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Anal Canal

Michael D. Chuong,corresponding author1 Jessica M. Freilich,1 Sarah E. Hoffe,1 William Fulp,2 Jill M. Weber,3 Khaldoun Almhanna,3 William Dinwoodie,3 Nikhil Rao,1 Kenneth L. Meredith,3 and Ravi Shridhar1

Gastrointest Cancer Res. 2013 Mar-Apr; 6(2): 39–45.

PURPOSE:

We compared our institutional experience using 3D conformal radiation therapy (3DCRT) vs. IMRT (intensity-modulated radiation therapy) for anal cancer.

METHODS:

We performed a single-institution retrospective review of all patients with squamous cell carcinoma anal cancer treated from September 2000 through September 2011, using definitive chemoradiation with curative intent.

RESULTS:

This study included 89 consecutive patients (37 3DCRT, 52 IMRT). Median follow-up for all patients, IMRT patients alone, and CRT patients alone was 26.5 months (range, 3.5–133.6), 20 months (range, 3.5–125.5), and 61.9 months (range, 7.6–133.6), respectively. Three-year overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), locoregional control (LRC), and colostomy-free survival (CFS) were 91.1%, 82.3%, 90.8%, and 91.3% in the IMRT cohort and 86.1%, 72.5%, 91.9%, and 93.7% in the 3DCRT group (all P > .1). More patients in the 3DCRT group required a treatment break (11 vs. 4; P = .006), although the difference in median treatment break duration was not significant (12.2 vs. 8.0 days; P = .35). Survival did not differ based on whether a treatment break was needed (all P > .1). Acute grade ≥3 nonhematologic toxicity was decreased in the IMRT cohort (21.1 vs. 59.5%; P < .0001). Acute grade ≥3 skin toxicity was worse in the 3DCRT group (P < .0001), whereas an improvement in late grade ≥3 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity was observed in the IMRT patients (P = .012).

CONCLUSIONS:

This study is the largest thus far to compare 3DCRT and IMRT for definitive treatment of anal cancer. Although long-term outcomes did not significantly differ based on RT technique, a marked decrease in adverse effects and the need for a treatment break was achieved with IMRT.
