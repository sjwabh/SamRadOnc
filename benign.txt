/HO /Heterotopic Ossification

Brooker classification

I little spot – small bone islands in soft tissues

II on both sides – with >1cm gap

III almost complete bridge, <1cm gap

IV  complete bridge w/ complete ankylosis of hip

Risk Factors: prior HO, male, Parkinsons

HO occurs in 30-43% of pts undergoing hip arthroplasty.

RT reduces risk to: 11% radiologic failure, 5% functional failure rate.

80% chance of recurrence if prior episode.

>60% if Hypertrophic OA, Ankylosing Spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), Paget's.

HO appears 3-6wks postop, fully formed in 8 wks.

NSAIDS (Indocin 25 TID x 3-6 mos) (Pakos, Red 04: Meta-Analysis showed RT better than NSAIDS), bisphosphonates.

Prophylactic RT only for posterior acetabular fx?

RT works on pluripotent osteogenitor mesenchymal cells, which are stimulated to proliferate after trauma.

APPA 700 cGy x 1, should be pre-op <8hrs, or post-op within 72 hrs of surgery.

Sometimes in elbow (we treat these too), spine.

After RT, will take longer, about 2x (12-16mos) as long for normal bone to heal.

Review of HO in 2009: Baird, Journal of Orthopaedic Surgery and Research 2009, 4:12 doi:10.1186/1749-799X-4-12

Risks: impaired wound healing, risk of non-union especially of long bones, temporary oligospermia, secondary malignancies

/Benign Diseases

/Exophthalmos /Graves ophthalmopathy

Sx: proptosis, diplopia, blurred vision, EOM dysfunction, lid lag, optic neuropathy, periorbital edema.

Etiol: T-lymphocyte infiltration to orbit, fibroblasts

Tx: try steroids first (2-8 wks), then orbital decompression surgery,

RT: 2000/10.  Higher doses don't help.

Opposed lats, 6x photons or 12-15e- electrons, split beam or posterior angulation to avoid lens.

Women do better.

AH says there's a RCT from Mayo on RT for Graves.  LOOK THIS UP.

In a series of 35 patients with thyroid ophthalmopathy, Sandler et al. (133) reported that 71% of patients receiving 20 Gy in 2-Gy fractions required no further steroid therapy or surgical decompression. Of the failures, 7/21 patients (33%) had failed prior steroid therapy; two of the seven patients (28%) had failed prior surgical decompression; and only one of seven patients (14%) had no prior treatment. The main prognostic factor for failure was an interval of <6 months between eye disease and radiation therapy. In a series of over 300 patients, Peterson et al. (112) showed that 20 Gy in 10 fractions gave identical results to 30 Gy in 15 fractions, and that as many as 76% of treated patients responded positively to treatment.

The risk of definite radiation retinopathy is 1% to 2% within 10 years after treatment.

/AVM

4 options: observation, surgery, embolization, SRS.

annual risk of hemorrhage 2-4% per year.

Good Prognosis Factors:

Size<2cm

SRS feasibility:

Diameter < 3cm

Wait 2-3 months after hemorrhage or surgery before giving RS.

Wait a few weeks after embolization before RS.

Target nidus only (not all feeding arteries/veins)

SRS Dose: PS says give as much as you can, depends on location. 16-20Gy.

CM does 21 Gy.

Threshold of 15-16Gy.

Others do 15-30Gy to the margin (50-70% isodose), depending on size, location, bleeding hx.

Use RS w/ frame.

Give Solumedrol 40mg (methylprednisolone) after RS.

You do get immediate benefit after SRS of risk reduction to 50%, then 88% by obliteration.

FU w/ MRI q6mo x 3 yrs.

If MRI @3yrs shows complete obliteration, get angio to confirm.

2yr Obliteration rates:

<2cm => 90-100%

>2cm => 50-70%

Toxicity risks: risk of brain necrosis depends on V12Gy < 10cc.

RT 180 x30 to 54Gy.

SRS: 12-13Gy. Crocker does 12Gy.  Stockholm 10-15Gy, Mayo 16-20 Gy.

PS does 800x3.

Outcomes:  LC rate: >90%

  Local Control worse if size >3cm.

Toxicities from SRS:

  70% stable hearing (10-15% hearing improves, 10-15% hearing gets worse)

  CN V: <5%

  CN VII: <5%

/Dupuytren's contracture

contracture of the palmar fascia.

Sx: cords and nodules

Tubiana's classification:...

Following Tubiana the degree by which the finger is bent is used to grade contracture into several stages. If more than one joint of a finger is bent, the angles of contracture are simply added together. Based on this total angle of contracture stages in the development of Morbus Dupuytren are usually classified as below. The initial stages N and N/I show no, or very little contraction.

 


 

 

Dr. David Cline from Boise, comes to Portland once per month.

 

Surgical release (needle aponeurotomy), then RT within 72h.

percutaneous fasciotomy

steroid injection

 

RT can reduce risk of progression post surgery from 60-70% down to 20-25%.

 

RT targets the fibroblasts or CD+ T lymphocytes that contribute to the scarring contracture.

 

RT:

300x5 with F2 orthovoltage (~120kV?), 6-8 wk break, then repeat 300x5. Total 30Gy.

 

Or 300x7=21Gy over 2 weeks.

 

Use orthovoltage 100-125kV, or 5e- electrons with 0.5cm bolus.

208 hands.

RT 300x5 ortho, 8 wk break, 300x5.  Total 30Gy.

 

In stage N 87% and in stage N/I 70% remained stable or even regressed. In more advanced stages, the rate of disease progression increased to 62% (stage I) or 86% (stage II). 66% of the patients showed a long-term relief of symptoms (i.e., burning sensations, itching and scratching, pressure and tension). Radiotherapy did not increase the complication rate after surgery in case of disease progression and only minor late toxicity (skin atrophy, dry desquamation) could be observed in 32% of the patients.
