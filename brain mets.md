The Quality of Life after Treatment for Brain Metastases (QUARTZ) study was a noninferiority, phase 3 randomized trial that showed that although side effects were higher in the WBRT (20 Gy in 5 fractions) arm, there were not more significant adverse events. WBRT did not significantly affect survival or reduce steroid use. WBRT also did not significantly improve quality-adjusted life years.

/WBI /WBRT

For multiple brain mets,

Non-randomized studies show WBI (w/o surgery) improves survival from 1 mo to 4 mos (from 3 to 6 months (JH)).

Steroids improves survival by 1 month.

Improve HA in 70%

Improves CN dysfunction in 40%

After WBI, only 40% of deaths are from brain mets.

WBI dose fracitonation: 300x10=3000

Use lower fractionation if pt going to get more chemo: 250 to 3750.

Side Effects of WBI: somnolence syndrome, dementia ...

No standard fractionation,

/Multiple brain mets

/SRS /RS Stereotactic Radiosurgery: for brain mets, AVMs

For mets < 3cm.  Suh doesn't do RS for more than 4 mets.

Can RS replace surgery?

Tradeoffs between Surgery vs RS:

Surgery:

Can do for any size,

acute removal, fast sx reslution,

histologic confirmation

rapid steroid taper

easy to follow pts

SRS:

min invasive

can treat deep lesions

lower cost than surgery

BUT, no histo confirmation, can only do for <3cm, longer steroids

Surgery vs RS decision:

Choose Surgery if:

tumor>35mm, +mass effect, single lesion, superficial, need tissue.

Choose RS if: deep, <35mm, poor surg risk, no mass effect, multiple lesions w/ good systemic control, radioresistant histo (RCC, melanoma).

/SRS Dose

1998-2009

PTV increased by about 50%

Now the larger cavities in 3 fx to 24Gy.

Median survival 17mo

Margin was only factor on univariate analysis.

2yr LC 94% vs 83% (p<.05) competing risk analysis

But other possible confounding factors: more experience, better MRI, dose higher now: 24-27Gy in 3 fx, was 21-24 in 3.

TIMING: Now also treating earlier after surgery.  He treats 1 wk after staples out.

MRI at 2 wks post op easier to see, than @ 5 wks.

They looked to see if cavity shrinks more if waiting up to 30 days, but it didn't at 30d, but at 3 mo or 6mo there is cavity shrinkage but we can't wait that long due to recurrences.

Only 26% of cases have cavity larger than pre-resection tumor. Most are smaller.

Necrosis/toxicity not worse w/ margin.

For larger brain mets, local therapy alone is inadequate, high rate of LR.

Cavity boost for >2cm.

Med OS 16 mo.

Risk of distant brain failure higher w/o WBI, up to 50-60%.

They treat SRT on consecutive days.

He uses same SRT doses for intact brain mets.

DDx: recurrent brain met vs radionecrosis

Try really hard not to do re-SRS because even if it's not radionecrosis this time, very likely will get radionecrosis after re-SRS.

Workup: MRI perfusion & spectroscopy, Brain PET

If specialized imaging suggests tumor recurrence, favor neurosurgical resection if possible, and only do re-SRS if can't resect.

If suggests radionecrosis,

  If asymptomatic -> observe (or low dose steroids) and re-image in a few mos.

  If symptomatic -> 

     trial of steroids

     Avastin

     Resect (last resort) if keeps progressing.
