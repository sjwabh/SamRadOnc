The Implications of Genetic Testing on Radiation Therapy Decisions: A Guide for Radiation Oncologists
"RB1, NF1, TP53, or PTCH1 genes, respec- tively. In patients with any of these 4 syndromes, there are no known enhanced risks of acute or late radiation toxic- ities, but the second malignancy risk in the irradiated field is thought to be elevated, even relative to the high back- ground risk of additional cancers in these patients."
















I feel, with many prospective randomized data, we are beyond looking at EQ2 dose for deciding fractionation. We follow the below rationale/pathway in our practice.
Is biology suitable for PBI or not? (If suitable then plan for 30 Gy in 5 fractions like Italian data) 
Biology is suitable for PBI but technically not possible (oncoplastic closure or hard to identify surgical bed or large seroma to breast ratio) then 26 Gy in 5 fractions whole breast RT (like FAST-Forward) 
Biology is not suitable for PBI and/or would benefit from boost than 40 in 15 with 10 Gy in 4 fraction boost. A small subset of these especially the elderly get 26 in 5 fractions whole breast followed by boost). We are not routinely doing SIB for now. 
If need regional node RT then 40 in 15 (like START B and Danish data) unless inflammatory breast cancer or poor response to chemotherapy and would benefit from a higher dose than 50 Gy in 25 fractions with 10-16 Gy boost to any undissected gross node.
For all these patients irrespective of dose/fractionation, we make sure no beam goes through the heart (dose to heart is from scatter or transmission).
The other most important aspect is coverage of tumor bed with prescription dose and dose homogeneity in breast where we aim for 105 to be <5% but accept up to <10 fractions for 15 fraction regimen.

/BSGI - Breast-Specific Gamma Imaging has comparable sensitivity but superior specificity when compared to MRI. BSGI, a molecular breast imaging technique that uses Tc-99 (sestamibi), is a follow-up to mammography that can see lesions independent of tissue density and discover early stage cancers. With BSGI, the patient receives a pharmaceutical tracing agent that is absorbed by all the cells in the body. Due to their increased rate of metabolic activity, cancerous cells in the breast absorb a greater amount of the tracing agent than normal, healthy cells and generally appear as "hot spots" on the BSGI image.

1.    The most significant risk factor for local recurrence in breast cancer is due to A) size, B) lymph node positivity, C) margin status.

I was not sure of the answer.  I put positive margins.  Per Park, et al (JCO 2000) at the Joint Center, local recurrence is 27% with extensively positive margins, 14% with locally positive margins and 7% with close or negative margins.

NEW:  Now NCCN 2014 says no RT after wide margin lumpectomy.   Need >1cm margins.

(Used to be lumpectomy+RT vs mastectomy.  )

From UpToDate 2015:

For some tumors, a 1 cm margin may not be possible even with a total mastectomy location. In such patients, radiation may be indicated even after a mastectomy. There is less agreement about the role of adjuvant RT when wide margins =1 cm can be obtained. Available data indicate that RT will substantially reduce recurrence for these patients [40]. We suggest RT in this setting but recognize that this is not uniformly recommended by others. Further studies are needed to determine when adjuvant RT should be advised in the treatment of phyllodes tumors. (See "Adjuvant radiation therapy for women with newly diagnosed, non-metastatic breast cancer".)

However, utilization of adjuvant RT appears to be modest. In a retrospective review of the National Cancer Database that included 3120 patients with malignant phyllodes tumor, only 14 percent received adjuvant RT [46]. Patients were more likely to receive radiation therapy if they were diagnosed later in the study, were 50 to 59 years old, had tumors >10 cm, or had lymph nodes removed. In adjusted models, adjuvant radiation reduced local recurrence but did not impact disease-free or overall survival with a median follow-up of 53 months.

for Breast Cancer

http://www.nejm.org.liboff.ohsu.edu/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1209825

Background

Radiotherapy for breast cancer often involves some incidental exposure of the heart

to ionizing radiation. The effect of this exposure on the subsequent risk of ischemic

heart disease is uncertain.

Methods

We conducted a population-based case–control study of major coronary events (i.e.,

myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart

disease) in 2168 women who underwent radiotherapy for breast cancer between

1958 and 2001 in Sweden and Denmark; the study included 963 women with major

coronary events and 1205 controls. Individual patient information was obtained

from hospital records. For each woman, the mean radiation doses to the whole heart

and to the left anterior descending coronary artery were estimated from her radiotherapy

chart.

Results

The overall average of the mean doses to the whole heart was 4.9 Gy (range, 0.03 to

27.72). Rates of major coronary events increased linearly with the mean dose to the

heart by 7.4% per gray (95% confidence interval, 2.9 to 14.5; P<0.001), with no apparent

threshold. The increase started within the first 5 years after radiotherapy

and continued into the third decade after radiotherapy. The proportional increase

in the rate of major coronary events per gray was similar in women with and

women without cardiac risk factors at the time of radiotherapy.

Conclusions

Exposure of the heart to ionizing radiation during radiotherapy for breast cancer

increases the subsequent rate of ischemic heart disease. The increase is proportional

to the mean dose to the heart, begins within a few years after exposure, and

continues for at least 20 years. Women with preexisting cardiac risk factors have

greater absolute increases in risk from radiotherapy than other women.

From /Brianne:

We reviewed that most cancers are sporadic; however, about 10% of cancers develop to an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome. Most of these are due to mutations in tumor suppressor genes that are passed on in families in an autosomal dominant fashion. Each of these syndromes are characterized by an increased risk for a cluster of specific types of cancers. Most inherited breast cancers are due to a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Female BRCA mutation carriers are at an increased risk for breast and ovarian cancer; males with a BRCA mutation have increased risks for male breast cancer and prostate cancer. 

 

We reviewed that clinical testing is available for several other genes associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. Some of the additional genes are considered "high risk", some are considered "moderate risk" and some are simply "newer genes". High risk breast cancer genes include BRCA1 and BRCA2, PTEN (Cowden syndrome), CDH1 (Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer syndrome), and TP53 (Li-Fraumeni syndrome). There are established cancer risks and recommendations for management of individuals with a mutation in high risk genes. Current NCCN guidelines (version 2.2015, 06/25/15) recommend for an individual with breast cancer at age 35 or younger, TP53 testing can be ordered alone, concurrently with BRCA1/2 testing and/or other gene testing or as a follow-up test after negative BRCA1/2 testing. Moderate risk genes include ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2. Historically, breast cancer risk associated with these genes is increased 2- to 4- fold. ATM and PALB2 have also been associated with an increased risk for pancreatic cancer, and CHEK2 has also been associated with an increased risk for prostate, colon, thyroid, and kidney cancers. However, there were no established guidelines for management of individuals with a ATM, CHEK2, or PALB2 mutation. On 03/30/2015, the NCCN updated recommendations to include a breast MRI for women with a ATM, CHEK2, or PALB2 mutation because the breast cancer risk >20%. A recent (August 2014) article in NEJM estimated the absolute breast cancer risk for women with a PALB2 mutation ranges from 33%-58% dependent on family history. 

 

Genetic testing for the "high" and "moderate" risk breast cancer genes, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, PTEN, STK11, and TP53, is available as a panel at Invitae (Breast cancer guidelines based panel).

BRCA+ MANAGEMENT:

OK to do BCT for BRCA pts.  After RT, BRCA pts (DO, DO NOT) have a higher IBTR risk in the radiated breast.

BRCA+ pts have higher contra breast incidence (40-50%), but this can be reduced by:

Consider prophylactic oophorectomy (reduces IBTR and CBTR by 40-50%), or ER modulators (TAM).
 

 

If positive mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, then her risk for a second primary breast cancer is about 40-50%. her lifetime risk for ovarian cancer would be 20-45%, depending on which gene change she is found to carry. As a mutation carrier, it would be recommended that she consider chemoprevention, increased surveillance, or prophylactic surgery to reduce her risk. We discussed that prophylactic mastectomy is 90-95% effective in reducing the risk for breast cancer. Prophylactic oophorectomy is at least 95-98% effective in reducing the risk for ovarian cancer. Chemoprevention options would include treatment with tamoxifen, which is shown to be 50-70% effective in reducing contralateral breast cancer occurrence in mutation carriers who have had breast cancer. Other options for increased surveillance, recommended in the literature, include yearly CA-125 values and transvaginal ultrasounds for surveillance for ovarian cancer, and mammograms alternating with breast MRI every 6 months, twice yearly clinical examinations, and regular self-examinations for surveillance for breast cancer.

People with a history of breast cancer may also be at increased risk for endometrial cancer, but this is difficult to determine as many of the risk factors for breast and endometrial cancer overlap. As of yet, there has not been any association found between genes associated with breast cancer, such as the BRCA1 gene, and endometrial cancer, though studies are ongoing,

 
From /Brianne:

/brca1

 Individuals with a BRCA1 mutation have a higher risk for developing certain types of cancer. These risks include an up to 84% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 44% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. Women with a BRCA1 mutation who have been diagnosed with breast cancer also have an increased risk of developing a second breast cancer.  In addition, men with a BRCA1 mutation may have an increased risk for developing male breast cancer and prostate cancer.  

/brca2

Individuals with a BRCA2 mutation have a higher risk for developing certain types of cancer. These risks include an up to 84% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 27% lifetime risk of developing ovarian cancer. Women with a BRCA2 mutation who have had breast cancer also have an approximately 12% risk of developing a second breast cancer within five years of the first, and a 16% risk of developing subsequent ovarian cancer. In addition, men have an increased risk for developing prostate cancer of approximately 20%, and an increased risk of approximately 8% for developing male breast cancer. Both men and women with a BRCA2 mutation are also at increased risk for developing melanoma and pancreatic cancer.

For both brca1 & brca2:

Because of your increased risk for developing these cancers, we discussed several options for your medical care.

Screening for breast cancer includes breast awareness and breast self-exam, clinical breast exam, and breast imaging. For women with a BRCA mutation, recommendations include:

1.   breast awareness beginning at age 18

2.   clinical breast exam every 6-12 months beginning at age 25

3.   annual breast MRI (preferred) or mammogram (if MRI is unavailable) beginning at age 25-29 (or individualized if breast cancer diagnosis under age 25 is present in the family)

4.   annual mammogram and breast MRI beginning at age 30

5.   after age 75, management should be considered on an individual basis

6.   option of prophylactic bilateral mastectomy (removal of both breasts before cancer occurs). However, since it is impossible to remove every breast tissue cell during a bilateral mastectomy, there is a residual risk of 5-10% for BRCA mutation carriers to develop a breast cancer in the remaining tissue. For this reason, if you do choose to have a bilateral mastectomy, we recommend lifetime screening for breast cancer to include breast awareness and clinical breast exam every 6-12 months.

7.   option of risk reduction agents. Tamoxifen may reduce the risk for breast cancer. If you are interested in this option, we recommend further discussion with a medical oncologist.

We recommend you further discuss these options with your breast surgeon and medical oncologist.

At this time, screening for ovarian cancer is not very effective and usually detects cancer once it is advanced. Therefore, the current recommendations for women with a BRCA mutation include:

1.   prophylactic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries before cancer occurs), typically between age 35-40, and upon completion of childbearing. This procedure is the best protection against ovarian cancer, and reduces your chance of developing ovarian cancer by 95-98%. However, there is a residual risk of about 2 -5% for developing primary peritoneal cancer in BRCA mutation carriers since the cells that line our peritoneum (the inside of our abdominal cavity) are from the same embryologic origin as our ovaries.

2.   data do not support routine ovarian cancer screening in women with a BRCA mutation. However, until the time of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, transvaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125 levels beginning at age 30-35 may be considered at the clinician’s discretion.

3.   option of risk reduction agents. Oral contraceptives may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer.

We recommend you further discuss these options with your gynecologist or a gynecologic oncologist. At your request, I am including the contact information for Gynecologic Oncology at Salem Cancer Institute, phone (503) 562-4855.

/brca1 continued...

Lastly, there may also be increased risks for pancreatic cancer and melanoma associated with BRCA gene mutations. However, at this time, the risk appears to be less with BRCA1 mutations than with BRCA2 mutations. Additionally, there are no standardized guidelines for pancreatic cancer or melanoma screening in individuals with a BRCA gene mutation; recommendations are usually based on family history. 

 

As we discussed, your test result also has meaning for other family members. Because BRCA1 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, each of your siblings and each of your children has a one-in-two (50%) chance of having the same mutation. 

 

Family members (over age 18) who are at increased risk of inheriting the mutation now become candidates for genetic testing if they wish to know their status. However, the testing can be complex and there are medical and social issues that should be understood before having the test. Therefore, should any family members wish to pursue testing, we suggest having a discussion with a genetics health professional, such as a genetic counselor, who is familiar with the testing process

/brca2 continued...

Lastly, individuals with a BRCA2 gene mutation are believed to also be increased risk for pancreatic cancer and melanoma. However, at this time, there are no standardized guidelines for pancreatic cancer or melanoma screening in individuals with a BRCA gene mutation; recommendations are usually based on family history. You did not report a family history of pancreatic cancer or melanoma.

·    Screening for melanoma with an annual full-body skin exam and annual ophthalmologic/eye exam (to detect ocular melanoma), could be considered.

·    The incidence of pancreatic cancer in the general population is less than 1%, and is believed to be increased up to 7% in some BRCA2 mutation carriers. Again, there is currently no consensus on the frequency or type of screening that should be done for BRCA2 mutation carriers.

As we discussed, your test result also has meaning for other family members. Because BRCA2 mutations are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, each of your siblings and each of your children has a one-in-two (50%) chance of having the same mutation.

If an individual inherits two BRCA2 mutations, he/she is affected with an autosomal recessive condition, Fanconi Anemia. Fanconi anemia is characterized by physical abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and increased risk of malignancy. Therefore, individuals with a BRCA2 mutation could consider preconception genetic counseling to determine if their partner also has a BRCA2 gene mutation and the chance to have a child affected with Fanconi anemia.

PMID 16164913 

12yr IBTR 14% of you get >1cm margins.

12yr invasive Recurrence 3.4% (very low proportion!)

BACKGROUND: Margin width has been shown previously to be the most important predictor of local treatment failure after breast conservation for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).

METHODS:

Five variables thought to be associated with local recurrence were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analysis in 455 nonrandomized patients with DCIS treated with excision alone.

RESULTS:

Multivariate analysis showed that margin width, age, nuclear grade, and tumor size all were independent predictors of local recurrence, with margin width as the single most important predictor. After adjusting for all other predictors the likelihood of local recurrence for patients with margins less than 10 mm was 5.39 times as much as that for patients with margins of 10 mm or more (95% confidence interval, 2.68-10.64).

CONCLUSIONS:

Margin width, the distance between DCIS and the closest inked margin, was the single most important predictor of local recurrence. As margin width increases, the risk for local recurrence decreases.

259 Patients with DCIS of the breast applying USC/Van Nuys prognostic index: a retrospective review with long term follow up.

The Van Nuys Prognostic Index (VNPI) is a simple score for predicting the risk of local recurrence (LR) in patients with Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) conservatively treated. This score combines three independent predictors of Local Recurrence. The VNPI has recently been updated with the addition of age as a fourth parameter into the scoring system (University of Southern California/ VNPI).

PATIENTS AND METHODS:

Our database consisted of 408 women with DCIS. Applying the USC/VNPI we reviewed retrospectively 259 patients who were treated with breast conserving surgery with or without radiotherapy (RT). Of these patients 63.5% had a low VNPI score, 32% intermediate and 4.5% a high score. In the low score group, the majority of the patients underwent Conservative Surgery (CS) without RT while in the intermediate group, almost half of the patients received RT. Eighty-three percent (83%) of the patients with high VNPI were treated with Conservative Surgery plus RT. Nodal assessment by Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy was obtained in 32 patients since 2002.

RESULTS:

Twenty-one Local Recurrences were observed (8%) with a mean follow up of 130 months: sixteen were invasive. No statistically significant differences in Disease Free Survival were reached in all groups of VNPI score between patients treated with Conservative Surgery or Conservative Surgery plus RT. However it was noted that the higher the VNPI score, the lower was the risk of local recurrence in the group treated additionally with RT, even though it was not statistically significant. Further analysis included those patients treated with Conservative Surgery alone and followed up. Disease-free survival (DFS) at 10 years was 94% with low VNPI and 83% in both intermediate and high score (P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the subgroups of VNPI. The Local Relapse rate after Conservative Surgery alone, increased with tumor size, margin width, and pathology classification (P < 0,05), while age was not found to be a significant factor. Lesions with only mammographic appearances are associated with lower DFS but it did not reach significance (P = ns), while assumption of estrogenic hormones and familial history of breast cancer are significant factors associated with a higher risk of local recurrence. After multivariate analysis including seven clinical and pathological factors, the only significant predictors of local recurrence remained margin width of surgical excision, previous therapy with estrogens (contraceptives or Hormone Replacement Therapy) and the Van Nuys pathologic classification. The overall survival breast cancer specific was 99% and no differences were observed between groups (P = ns). The comparison of patients treated with a total mastectomy and those conservatively treated showed a significantly better local relapse free survival rate obtained with mastectomy (98.2% vs. 89.7% at 10 years P = 0.02). However, the overall cause-specific survival did not prove any better outcome (98.7% in both groups). Of the 32 patients who underwent a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy, four were found to have micrometastases and all of them had a previous Directional Vacuum Assisted Biopsy.

CONCLUSIONS:

Although in our series there is not a significant difference in LR rates by the parameter of age, the new USC/VNPI is still a simple and reliable scoring system for therapeutic management of DCIS. We did not find any statistically significant advantage in groups treated with the addition of RT. Obtaining wide surgical margins appears to be the strongest prognostic factor for local recurrence, regardless of other pathological factors or the addition of adjuvant radiation therapy. However, only prospective randomized studies can precisely predict the risk of LR of conservatively treated DCIS. The clinical significance of Sentinel Lymph Nodes micrometastases Immuno-Histo-Chemistry-detected found in DCIS patients remains uncertain. However, we hypothesize that the anatomical disruption after preoperative biopsy procedures increases the likelihood of epithelial cell displacement and the frequency of IHC-positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes, both of which are directly proportional to the degree of manipulation.

BOOST for DCIS?

Consider for young, high grade, close margins.

The impact of a tumour-bed boost to further improve local control is being tested in two on-going randomised

trials [100,101].

Eight-year follow up result of the OTOASOR trial: The Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla – Surgery Or Radiotherapy after positive sentinel lymph node biopsy in early-stage breast cancer
2017
Introduction
The National Institute of Oncology, Budapest conducted a single centre randomized clinical study. The OTOASOR (Optimal Treatment Of the Axilla – Surgery Or Radiotherapy) trial compares completion of axillary lymph node dissection (cALND) to regional nodal irradiation (RNI) in patients with sentinel lymph node metastasis (pN1sn) in stage I–II breast cancer.
Patients and methods
Patients with primary invasive breast cancer (cN0 and cT ≤ 3 cm) were randomized before surgery for cALND (standard treatment) or RNI (investigational treatment). Sentinel lymph nodes (SN) were investigated with serial sectioning at 0.5 mm levels by hematoxylin–eosin staining. Investigational treatment arm patients received 50 Gy RNI instead of cALND. Adjuvant treatment and follow up were performed according to the actual guidelines. Between August 2002 and June 2009, 1054 patients were randomized for cALND and 1052 patients for RNI. SN was evaluated in 2073 patients and was positive in 526 patients (25.4%). 474 cases were evaluable (244 in the cALND and 230 in the RNI arm), and in the cALND group 94 of 244 patients (38.5%) who underwent completion axillary surgery has additional positive nodes. The two arms were well balanced according to the majority of main prognostic factors. Primary endpoint was axillary recurrence and secondary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS).
Results
Mean follow-up was 97 months (Q1–Q3: 80–120). Axillary recurrence was 2.0% in cALND arm vs. 1.7% in RNI arm (p = 1.00). OS at 8 years was 77.9% vs. 84.8% (p = 0.060), and DFS was 72.1% in cALND arm and 77.4% after RNI (p = 0.51). The results show that RNI is statistically not inferior to cALND treatment.
Conclusions
The long term follow-up results of this prospective-randomized trial suggest that RNI without cALND does not increase the risk of axillary failure in selected patients with early-stage invasive breast cancer (cT ≤ 3 cm, cN0) and pN1(sn). Axillary radiotherapy should be an alternative treatment for selected patients with sentinel lymph node metastases.

Tumor Gene Expression Subtypes:

Receptor status was traditionally considered by reviewing each individual receptor (ER, PR, her2) in turn, but newer approaches look at these together, along with the tumorgrade, to categorize breast cancer into several conceptual molecular classes[33] that have different prognoses[11] and may have different responses to specific therapies.[34]DNA microarrays have assisted this approach, as discussed in the following section. Proposed molecular subtypes include:

Basal-like: ER-, PR- and HER2-; also called triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)[35] Most BRCA1 breast cancers are basal-like TNBC.

Luminal A: ER+ and low grade

Luminal B: ER+ but often high grade

Luminal ER-/AR+: (overlapping with apocrine and so called molecular apocrine) - recently identified androgen responsive subtype which may respond to antihormonal treatment with bicalutamide[31]

ERBB2/HER2+: has amplified HER2/neu[27]

 

 

                  ER    PR    Her2  Grade Ki-67

Luminal A :       +     +     -     I/II  <14%  (if age>60 N- getting Tam, may not need post-op RT)

Luminal B :       +     +     +           >14%

Basal(Triple-):   -     -     -

  (BRCA1+)

HER2 classic:     -     -     +

Her2 variant:

 

/Her2/neu: EGFR on chr17. Poor prognostic factor. 

Her2+ in 25% of IBC,

Her2+ in 55% of DCIS!!

 

Measure by IHC, FISH:

IHC: 1+ 2+ or 3+.  If 2+ or 3+, then do FISH 1+ 2+ 3+

1+ negative

2+ equivocal

3+ positive

 

If IHC+, what is chance that FISH+?

 

 

Higher risk of +LN, less likely to be ER/PR +.

Less responsive to some systemic agents.

CM: IMRT:

I more frequently have rejected a plan because of lung dose, lack of coverage, or heart dose (in that order).  I place less weight on the heart dose because, while I work to decrease the dose, I am still underimpressed by its importance.

That being said, I looked at some papers I have regarding IMRT planning for left sided breast cancers and it looks like the max doses are all over. Lori Pierce’s paper used a max dose of 15 Gy and a mean dose of 5 Gy for the LAD. Minesh Mehta’s paper had a heart max dose of 30 Gy with a V 10 Gy < 15%. I don’t think the first is reasonable but I think the second is more doable.

Toxicity @3yrs: Only lung (fibrosis; dyspnoea; pneumonitis; any lung toxicities) (4.3% vs. 1.3%; p < 0.0001) but not cardiac toxicity (0.3% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.55) significantly increased with IM-MS treatment.

If No SNB,

  Treat axilla if LN risk > 10% (T1b and above)

  Add SCV if can tolerate lung fibrosis.

 

If +SNB, but no ALND,

Favor more completion ALND over RT if possible, so less lung CA risk. STILL TRUE??

 

But +SNB but if no ALND (can't, won't, or shouldn't..):

If only 1+ SLN and no LVSI, just high tangents.

If >1 +SLN or LVSI, add SCV.

 

MDACC: If only 1 +SLN and no LVSI, treat axilla only w/ modified tangents. (Red 2004;59:1074-79)

MGH: If pN1mic and no LVSI, don't need SCV. (Red 2006;65:40-44).

But MIRROR study says worse axillary recurrence if no axRT or cALND.

 

If you DO get full ALND,

If >=4 +N or T3-4, SCV

If 2-3 +N and NR>25%, SCV

If 2-3 +N and gross +ECE or (microECE & LVSI), SCV

If 2-3 +N and NR<25%, "gray zone" (Consider: age,LVSI,ILC...)

If 1 +N and NR<25%, no SCV, just do high tangents.

 

If >=4 +N and UIQ (shouldn't we do it for LIQ too?), add IMN

Ann Oncol. 2008 Aug;19(8):1393-401. Epub 2008 Apr 2.

 Following adjustment for number of lymph node metastases and other baseline prognostic factors, ECS was not significantly associated with any of the three recurrence types studied.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our results indicate that the decision for additional regional radiotherapy should not be based solely on the presence of ECS.

We recommend breast/chest wall and supraclavicular radiation for all patients with pathologic evidence of such extranodal extension who have had a level I and II axillary dissection regardless of the number of positive axillary nodes. Axillary irradiation should be considered for patients who have had only an axillary sampling or level I axillary dissection.

So no survival benefit for LN dissection.

RT: Tangents 50 in 25, SCV to 45, IMC to 45.  Boost 10-20 Gy if N+.

 

No diff in OS, DFS, RFS, distant DFS.

But for cN-, LRR was lowest for TM+RT group (even better than RM!)

Of RM pts w/ clinically negative axilla, 40% found to have +LN at RadMastect.

Of TM only pts w/ cN- who didn’t get RT, 18.6% rate of eventual axillary failure with median time to failure 14.8 months, which means only about half of pts w/ path +N had axillary failure as first detected event.

 

RT achieved similar LC as surgery in cN- axilla, but not in cN+ axilla.

 

Pts who had 6+ nodes removed did not have increased axillary recurrence.

 

Pts in B04 who got RT had 2x risk of second lung CA (but not in B06), cuz in B04 treated regional nodes (SCV, IMC).

No increased risk of lung CA in B06 (but yes in B04).

 

 

 

/BCT vs MT: Including B06, 6 of 6 major RCTs show BCT vs mastectomy has equivalent survival, but MT has better LRR than BCT in 4 of 6 trials.

/Jatoi - AJCO 2005 "DOI: 10.1097/01.coc.0000156922.58631.d7"

Median FU 14.7yrs.

In conclusion, this pooled analysis confirms that BCT

and MT have comparable effects on mortality in women with

primary breast cancer, even after long-term follow up. However,

BCT is associated with a significantly greater risk of

locoregional recurrence. For women at high risk for local

recurrence, MT with immediate breast reconstruction should

be considered.

Critiques:  Not all age>70 are the same.  Are these pts really going to take HT x 5 yrs?  Benefit of HT is mostly after 5yrs, while benefit of RT is in <5yrs. So perhaps HT should be omitted, instead of RT.
Modern RT may have less toxicity than what was given in pre-2004. Or maybe OK to skip if over age 75 instead of age 70.




in addition to patient age and size of tumor, include high tumor grade, lymphovascular invasion, or low intensity of ER expression, all of which increase the rates of local failure and may make RT more desirable.

Gene expression and benefit of chemotherapy in women with node-negative,

SO J Clin Oncol. 2006 Aug 10;24(23):3726-34. Epub 2006 May 23. PMID 16720680

 

  PURPOSE: The 21-gene recurrence score (RS) assay quantifies the likelihood of

distant recurrence in women with estrogen receptor-positive, lymph node-negative

breast cancer treated with adjuvant tamoxifen. The relationship between the RS

and chemotherapy benefit is not known. METHODS: The RS was measured in tumors

from the tamoxifen-treated and tamoxifen plus chemotherapy-treated patients in

the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) B20 trial. Cox

proportional hazards models were utilized to test for interaction between

chemotherapy treatment and the RS. RESULTS: A total of 651 patients were

assessable (227 randomly assigned to tamoxifen and 424 randomly assigned to

tamoxifen plus chemotherapy). The test for interaction between chemotherapy

treatment and RS was statistically significant (P = .038). Patients with high-RS

(> or = 31) tumors (ie, high risk of recurrence) had a large benefit from

chemotherapy (relative risk, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.53; absolute decrease in

10-year distant recurrence rate: mean, 27.6%; SE, 8.0%). Patients with low-RS

(< 18) tumors derived minimal, if any, benefit from chemotherapy treatment

(relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI, 0.46 to 3.78; absolute decrease in distant

recurrence rate at 10 years: mean, -1.1%; SE, 2.2%). Patients with intermediate-

RS tumors did not appear to have a large benefit, but the uncertainty in the

estimate can not exclude a clinically important benefit. CONCLUSION: The RS

assay not only quantifies the likelihood of breast cancer recurrence in women

with node-negative, estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, but also predicts

the magnitude of chemotherapy benefit.

/BluePrint - 

A large study followed the outcomes of neoadjuvant treatment in HER2+ cancers and their correlation with BluePrint test results. Agendia reported that BluePrint reclassified about 22% of HER2+ tumors from the initial diagnosis. BluePrint identified a subtype (‘luminal’) within these cancers that turned out to be resistant to neoadjuvant therapy with chemotherapy and Herceptin. However, this subtype has a better response when pertuzumab (Perjeta—a newer HER2-targeted drug) is added to the Herceptin.

These data show that BluePrint could identify which patients with HER2+ should receive Perjeta as part of their neoadjuvant treatment.

Patients with TNBC have increased pCR rates compared with non-TNBC, and those with pCR have excellent survival. However, patients with RD after neoadjuvant chemotherapy have significantly worse survival if they have TNBC compared with non-TNBC, particularly in the first 3 years.

And then, residual volume correlates w/ outcome.

75% of LR occurred within 5 yrs

For BCT (7300 pts), mostly N-, RT improves

5yr LRR 7 v 26% (19%)

15yr BC mortality 30.5% v 35.9% (5.4%)

15yr Overall Mortality 35.2% v 40.5% (5.3%)

 

For N+ after BCS, 46% LRR at 10 yrs, even after chemo. These pts benefit even MORE from RT.

 

For PMRT for N+ (8500 pts), RT improves

5yr LRR 6% vs 23% (17%)

15yr BC mortality 54.7% v 60.1% (5.4%)

15yr overall mortality 59.8% v 64.2% (4.4%)

 

For every 4 local recurrences prevented, can prevent 1 death.

 

Found that PMRT for N- worsens 15yr OS.

5yr LRR 2% v 6%

15yr OS: NO Benefit.

(RT increases risk of contralat BC by RR 1.2)

Improved survival despite RT causing incr risk of contralat BC (Ratio 1.18), non-BC mortality (Ratio 1.12) (mostly cardiac & lung)

Critiques: outdated RT techniques, mmg has improved, adjuv therapy has changed.

Cardiac risk ratio: 1.27

 

 

If you have >10% abs benefit in LRR at 5yrs, then you will get 15yr OS benefit.

If you have <10% abs benefit in LRR at 5yrs, then you won't.

From UpToDate (2013 10 28):

Effect of radiation dose to the heart — There does not appear to be any minimum radiation dose that is entirely safe, and the effects of radiation on the heart increase with increasing doses of radiation [9]. The increased risk can be seen within the first five years and remains elevated for at least 20 years. Women with significant risk factors for an acute coronary event may be at a particularly increased risk.

This effect of RT was demonstrated in a population-based case-control study that included 2168 women who were treated for breast cancer with surgery and RT in Sweden and Denmark between 1958 and 2001 . The study included 963 women who experienced a significant coronary event (myocardial infarction, revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease) following their treatment for breast cancer. These women were compared with 1205 matched controls who received similar therapy for their breast cancer but did not have a cardiac event following breast cancer treatment. Radiation therapy records were reviewed for all patients, and the dose of radiation to the heart estimated for each patient.

Results included the following [10]:

    There was increased risk of major coronary events following RT for all time periods from the period less than five years through greater than 20 years.

    The estimated mean dose of radiation to the heart was 4.9 Gy; the dose of radiation to the heart was greater in those with a left-sided breast cancer (6.6 Gy versus 2.9 Gy). The risk of a coronary event increased progressively with the radiation dose, with an increase of 7.4 percent for each 1 Gy of radiation to the heart.

    A history of ischemic heart disease was associated with an increased risk of a cardiac event after treatment for breast cancer (ratio 6.67, p<0.001). Other factors also associated with a significantly increased risk included other circulatory disease, diabetes, or a left sided breast cancer (risk ratios 1.88, 3.23, and 1.32, respectively). 

Only a very limited number of patients received potentially cardiotoxic medications (eg, anthracyclines, trastuzumab), which might substantially increase the risk associated with RT. Furthermore, this analysis did not take into account other cardiac complications of radiation (cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, arrhythmias). (See 'Other manifestations' below.)

Additional evidence comes from tumor registry studies that have analyzed the rate of cardiac complications in breast cancer survivors [11,14-19]. These studies have yielded conflicting results but suggest that there is an increase in cardiac events in women with left-sided breast tumors compared with right-sided cancers, since the latter received lower doses of irradiation to the heart. Two of the larger studies illustrate the potential impact of RT based upon the laterality of the tumor:

    In one report, outcomes were analyzed from 115,000 women in the SEER database who received adjuvant RT in the United States between 1973 and 2001 [14]. For patients irradiated between 1973 and 1982, cardiac mortality was significantly higher in women with left-sided breast cancers and the difference was more pronounced with longer follow-up (cardiac mortality ratio [CMR] for left-sided versus right-sided cancers 1.20, 1.42, and 1.58, for <10, 10-14, and >15 years, respectively). However, for women treated from 1983 to 1992, the differences were less pronounced and not statistically significant, and none of the patients treated from 1993 on had 10-year follow-up. This decrease in excess mortality may reflect improvements in RT techniques, shorter follow-up, or other unknown factors.

    In a second SEER database study, the risk of death from ischemic heart disease was analyzed in a cohort of 27,283 women with breast cancer whose treatment included adjuvant RT during the period 1973 to 1989 [11]. For women diagnosed between 1973 and 1979, there was a significantly higher 15-year mortality rate from ischemic heart disease for women with left-sided versus right-sided tumors (13.1 versus 10.2 percent). For those diagnosed from 1980 to 1984, and from 1985 to 1989, the differences in 15-year mortality rates for women with left-sided versus right-sided tumors were not significant (9.4 versus 8.7 percent and 5.8 versus 5.2 percent, respectively). The overall incidence of death from cardiac disease decreased substantially with the later cohorts.

The absolute increase in risk of a major coronary event or death from ischemic heart disease is small. In the case control study comparing women given RT who had a major coronary event with those did not have a coronary event [10], the authors calculated that the risk that a 50 year-old women with no other coronary risk factors would die of ischemic heart disease prior to age 80 years would increase from 1.9 to 2.4 percent if she received a mean dose of radiation of 3 Gy to her heart; the risk of having at least one major coronary event would increase from 4.5 to 5.4 percent. If the mean dose to the heart were 10 Gy, the risk of dying would increase from 1.9 to 3.4 percent and the risk of having at least one acute coronary event would increase from 4.5 to 7.7 percent.

Numerous other studies, using either overall morbidity and mortality frequencies or less detailed individual patient data, confirm that the effect of radiation on the heart is small compared with the benefit potentially derived from such treatment in appropriately selected patients [20-26].

    Problem with RT to implants is capsular contracture.

autologous (autogenous) - better to do RT before autologous rather than after.

  TRAM

  DIEP

 

In general RT to autologous better cosmesis than RT to implants, if you give it time to "take". 

 

 

If planning IMPLANT,

CM used to recommend radiating the expanders, then swap out after RT.

Now recommend swap out first and RT the implant.

 

CM: My hunch is that radiating the implant is better but most plastic surgeons want to radiate the expander so they can do revisions when they swap out. I usually do what the plastic surgeon wants since I don't have good data either way. I only ask for deflation if it is in the way. That does mean they may need a second simulation if they need deflation. I do use bolus usually 0.5 cm each day. I give 5040 cGy and don't boost. I only use IMrt if it helps with lung or heart dose (these always seem to be on the left). I wouldn't do IM nodes but you could make the argument to do that.

 

 

And MSKCC /cordeiro, plast recon surg 2003,

recently recommended expansion during chemo, swap to permanent implant after chemo before RT. Reasonable delay (3-6wks per jwatson).  Then radiate implants.

capsular contraction worse w/ RT

3/4 pts satisfied w/ cosmetic outcome

Bolus can worsen cosmesis.

 

Cordeiro, Plast Reconstr Surg 113:877-881, 2004

 

Hallberg:

Alloderm implant is latest thing.

 

 

Radiating implants:  Use 0.5cm bolus.  Go to 50Gy?

 

skin sparing mastectomy

total skin sparing mastectomy

 

 

 

Hallberg: You have a lot more time before start for PMRT cuz recurrences typically don't happen for at least a year.  OK to wait ~4 mos.  Different from post-lumpect where you need to start sooner.  So in IMPLANT setting, dont' start RT until incision is COMPLETELY healed, don't start RT even when there's still a little scab that's not healed yet.

Reccurrences after Mastectomy:

 

Multiple studies (including Recht, et al, and Katz, et al) have shown that the extent of metastatic involvement of the axilla is the single greatest predictor of local/regional recurrence of breast cancer following mastectomy.

 

 

Timing of recurrences: RT delays recurrences.  With RT, 40% of recurrences are within 5 yrs. (Without RT, 73% of recurrences are within 5 yrs.)

 

•       Median time to recurrence is 2-3 years with 73% recurring within 5 years, but 25% recur btw 5-10 years

Tx:

Manual Lymph Drainage (MLD) – This form of gentle massage helps break up the buildup of lymph fluid and encourages proper flow.

Support Bras – Unsupported breasts may increase the problems associated with breast lymphedema. Women should be professionally fitted for a comfortable, well-fitted bra. Make sure straps are not cutting into your shoulders or back.

Compression Vests – Compression vests can help support breasts and help increase the flow of lymph fluid. Some women also find sleeping in compression vests helpful for nighttime comfort.

Chip Pads – Also called “Schneider packs,” these foam inserts may help knead or massage the swollen area. They can easily be added to compression vests or support bras.

Additional treatment options may include specific exercises to help reduce lymph fluid buildup, as well as topical skin care to help decrease irritation or inflamed areas of the breast.

/Floyd & Taghian: Review of PMRT for T3N0, RO 2009, "doi:10.1016/j.radonc.2008.09.015"

Looked at 8 studies that had T3N0 pts, and found LF without RT ranged from 7% to 38% (and up to 3 of 5 in one study), which is pretty high, so concludes that PMRT decisions "must be made on an individual basis".

 

 

CM: For neoadjuv, if SLN+, decide then to give PMRT.

 

 

Indications to treat CW after MRM:

(Donegan, Fowble, Danish, BC)

Consider for any (+) ALN in preMP

≥ 4 (+) ALN à 25-30% LRR risk

1-3 (+) ALN à 15% LRR risk

Tumor > 5 cm  à 20-30%  LRR risk

 

PMRT cuts LR in half.

 

 

(Consensus statements from ASTRO, ACR, ASCO)

For 1-3 nodes: However, some subsets of these patients are likely to have such a low risk of LRF that the absolute benefit of PMRT is outweighed by its potential toxicities. Thus, the decision to recommend PMRT or not requires a great deal of clinical judgment. should consider factors that may decrease the risk of LRF, attenuate the benefit of reduced breast cancer–specific mortality, and/or increase the risk of complications resulting from PMRT. These factors include: patient characteristics (age > 40 to 45 years, limited life expectancy because of older age or comorbidities, or coexisting conditions that might increase the risk of complications), pathologic findings associated with a lower tumor burden (eg, T1 tumor size, absence of lymphovascular invasion, presence of only a single positive node and/or small size of nodal metastases, or substantial response to NAST), and biologic characteristics of the cancer associated with better outcomes and survival and/or greater effectiveness of systemic therapy (eg, low tumor grade or strong hormonal sensitivity;

The evidence for improved overall survival and local control following PMRT for T4 tumors, positive resection margins, >3 positive lymph nodes and in T3 N0 patients with risk factors such as lymphovascular invasion, G3 grading, close margins, and young age has increased. Recently identified risk factors such as invasive lobular subtype and negative hormone receptor status were included. For patients with 1-3 positive lymph nodes, the recommendation for PMRT has reached the 1a level of evidence.

PMRT is mandatory in patients with T4 tumors and/or positive lymph nodes and/or positive resection margins. PMRT should be strongly considered in patients with T3 N0 tumors and risk factors, particularly when two or more risk factors are present.

OLD STUFF:

PreOp vs PostOp Chemo for Breast:

PreOp Advantages: allow for more BCT, better oxygenated tumor.

PreOp Disadvantages: need to know nodal status pre-chemo (SNB).

 

Path response has become surrogate end point for DFS, OS.  Opportunity for more expeditious eval of systemic therapies.

 

Indications:

tumor size>3cm (CDK says it's more the ratio of tumor size to breast size.)

any clinical node +

 

Contraindications(?): Don't even try for ER+, Lobular, Luminal A (don't benefit from any chemo)

If unlikely to be downstaged,

If already candidate for BCS,

If can do BCS but such high risk for IBTR, shouldn't really do BCS,

Don't bother w/ neoadjuv chemo.

This trial found that adding Docetaxol (pre op or post op) helped only if you had a partial response to AC. 
If you had either a great response (cCR) or no response to AC, then adding Docetaxol didn't really help (basically, you're screwed).
Conclusion: If you get an inbetween so-so response to preOp AC, then add Docetaxol.

post-radiation breast /fibrosis

From UpToDate 2023:
The risk for developing radiation-induced fibrosis after conventional RT for breast cancer is low, particularly with the use of modern skin-sparing megavoltage equipment. Signs and symptoms can include skin retraction and induration, pain, necrosis and ulceration, restricted arm and neck movement, lymphedema, and brachial or cervical plexopathy [48]. 


More prolonged therapy may be an important factor in reversing the effects of radiation-induced fibrosis. In a detailed longitudinal series, regression of superficial radiation-induced fibrosis following irradiation for breast cancer was assessed in 44 women with 55 areas of superficial radiation-induced fibrosis during and after treatment with pentoxifylline (800 mg/day) plus tocopherol (1000 units/day) [1]. Seven patients were treated for 6 to 12 months and therapy was then discontinued, while 37 patients remained on treatment for 24 to 48 months.

Overall, the mean estimated maximal regression in surface area of radiation-induced fibrosis was 68 percent, and this regression required an average of 24 months of treatment. The time to maximum regression of radiation-induced fibrosis was shorter in patients with fibrosis of less than six years duration (16 versus 28 months for those with fibrosis of longer duration). Among the seven patients who were treated for 6 to 12 months, a rebound increase in fibrotic area was observed after cessation of treatment.

Women between 18 and 42 years of age who desired to become pregnant and had completed 18–30 months of adjuvant endocrine therapy for early-stage ER + breast cancer were eligible to enroll in POSITIVE. An interruption of endocrine therapy for up to 2 years is permitted to allow pregnancy attempt (after a 3-month washout period), delivery, and breastfeeding. Resumption of endocrine therapy to complete 5–10 years of treatment is expected as soon as pregnancy and breastfeeding are finished, or after it is determined that conception is not possible. The accrual goal was 500 patients.
The limited evidence available on breastfeeding after breast cancer reports successful lactation from the treated breast in approximately 30% of women without detrimental effect on survival. No prospective definitive data are available.
