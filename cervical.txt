LSIL[5]

HSIL

The least risky type, represents only mild dysplasia, or abnormal cell growth.[3] It is confined to the basal 1/3 of the epithelium. This usually corresponds to infection with HPV, and may be cleared by immune response, though it can take several years to clear.

Formerly subdivided into CIN2 and CIN3.

Moderate dysplasia confined to the basal 2/3 of the epithelium

Severe dysplasia that spans more than 2/3 of the epithelium, and may involve the full thickness. This lesion may sometimes also be referred to as cervical carcinoma in situ.

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (2) koilocytosis.jpg
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (3) CIN2.jpg
However most CIN spontaneously regress. Left untreated, about 70% of CIN-1 will regress within one year, and 90% will regress within two years.[10] About 50% of CIN 2 will regress within 2 years without treatment.

Progression to cervical carcinoma in situ (CIS) occurs in approximately 11% of CIN1 and 22% of CIN2. Progression to invasive cancer occurs in approximately 1% of CIN1, 5% in CIN2 and at least 12% in CIN3.[11]

Progression to cancer typically takes 15 (3 to 40) years. Also, evidence suggests that cancer can occur without first detectably progressing through these stages and that a high grade intraepithelial neoplasia can occur without first existing as a lower grade.

cervical carcinoma in situ. /cis

Longitudinal studies have shown that in untreated patients with in situ cervical cancer, 30% to 70% will develop invasive carcinoma over a period of 10 to 12 years. However, in about 10% of patients, lesions can progress from in situ to invasive in a period of less than 1 year.

/PET was approved by CMS for coverage on 11/10/2009 for cervical CA. "As a result, CR 6753 provides that"

The findings are to be used to determine the location and extent of the cervical carcinoma for any of the three following therapeutic roles:

1) To judge if the patient is a good candidate for invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures

2) To determine the anatomic site for an intervention

3) And to measure the anatomic extent of tumors targeted for therapy.

This article has a good discussion of the value of PET for determining treatment fields (EFRT vs pelvic only):

Magne, New trends in the evaluation and treatment of cervix cancer: The role of FDG–PET, Cancer Treatment Reviews, 2008, 34(8), "doi:10.1016/j.ctrv.2008.08.003"

Describe your /pelvic exam:

First examine the external genitalia, ensuring no lesions or ulcerations, palpate for inguinal adenopathy.  

Digital exam of the vaginal vault to ensure that any potential tumor will not be traumatized by speculum insertion.  Feel for masses along vaginal walls, palpate cervix, patency of os, feel for size and consistency of any cervical mass, determine size of mass, mobility of mass, explore fornices, extension to upper vaginal walls.

Insert speculum, visualize vaginal mucosa, visualize cervix, look for os, on withdrawing speculum rotate 90 degrees to visualize anterior and posterior vaginal walls.  

Do bimanual exam to assess adnexal fullness and location of uterus.  Do rectovaginal exam to check for parametrial fullness, sweep 2 fingers laterally to assess whether or not they come together.  Failure of fingers to come together suggests parametrial extension.  Determine if mass goes all the way to sidewalls.  If mass is immobile, also suspect sidewall involvement.

Prognostic Factors: Stage, bulk, size>4cm, LN, Anemia Hb<12, adenoCA if stage II (?), 

HPV, Hemoglobin.

AdenoCA of cervix:  relative prognosis is controversial. Eifel (GynOnc 1995;59;38) says they do worse, but SEER analysis from Chen (Obstet Gynecol. 2008 Jun;111(6):1394-402) shows that AdenoCA does better than SCC for Stage I, but worse for Stage II. Interesting.

/Cervical Treatment:

Favor definitive CRT for IB2 (bulky) or above.

Can CONSIDER surgery up to IIA, but for IB2, High risk of pelvic LN, so will probably need pelvic RT anyway, (In Landoni, 84% of IB2 needed PORT, and worse toxicities w/ RH+RT) so favor definitive CRT.

IA1 EFH alone or Brachy alone
IA2 MRH+PelvicLND or Brachy alone 700x5-6
IB1 RH+(Pelvic+PA)LND or EBRT+Brachy alone (or chemoRT if >2cm) to 80Gy 
IB2 or greater: Definitive CRT, 85Gy

For IB1, favor surgery if younger pt (preserve ovarian function, no secondary malignancy risk, less toxicities than pelvic RT).
For IB1, "Why no chemo she asked? Well this is an area of some controversy (common phrase I used all day) but all the C/RT studies were for IB2 and above, so data is lacking. At my institution we start to add chemo when tumors are about 2cm. OK."


/hysterectomy types:

Type 1: /EFH /TAH: Extrafascial Hysterectomy (TAH): cervix, +/- small vaginal cuff 
Type 2: /MRH : modified radical hysterectomy: cervix, 1-2cm vaginal cuff, 1/2 of uterosacral&cardinal ligaments and parametrium medial to the ureters. Unroof ureters. 
Type 3: /RH : radical hysterectomy: 1/3 vagina, PM tissues all the way to sidewalls, all of broad&uterosacral&cardinal ligs, uterine vessels ligated at origin.  Unroof ureters to the bladder. Mobilize bowel & bladder. No ovaries/ tubes.
Type 4: Pelvic Exenteration

(For IB or IIA (From Landoni, 1997), RT alone is equivalent to Surgery.)

For IB or IIA Cervical, 

RH (+/-RT) vs RT alone

343 pts

Dose: 47Gy EBRT + LDR brachy = Total PtA 76Gy (sub standard)

Also EFRT if +PA or +common iliac LNs.

Surgery arm also got PORT 50.4 if +PM, +LN, close marg <3mm 

(overall 64% required PORT, 54% of IB1, 84% of IB2)

No diff in 5yr OS (83%), DFS (74%).

Surgery + RT arm had more severe Grade 2-3 toxicity (28% v 12%) (higher than average, a criticism of this study).

Adeno did worse w/ RT alone. 

The combination of surgery and radiotherapy has the worst morbidity, especially urological complications.

This trial showed that 84% of IB2 required PORT resulting in higher toxicities, so might as well do RT alone.

Comments: Low total PtA dose, higher toxicity rate than average.

/GOG71, Keys, GynOnc 2003, "doi:10.1016/S0090-8258(03)00173-2"

For Bulky IB (>4cm) (no LNs by CT), don't need Adjuvant Surgery.

RT vs RT+EFH

RT alone dose: EBRT 40Gy + Brachy 40Gy = 80Gy to PtA

RT+EFH dose: EBRT 45Gy + Brachy 30Gy = 75Gy to PtA

Lower CIR @5yrs 14% v 27% (and improved PFS 62% v 53%) w/ RT+EFH.

Overall, no benefit to Adjuvant Surgery, except for those w/ smaller tumors 4-6cm.

If still large residual tumor after EBRT, Schray does reduced dose T&O 750x2 ("drill a hole"), then planned EFH.  Bill Small does 75Gy LDR equiv, which is about HDR 600x3 after 45Gy pelvic EBRT.

Lower GI /Toxicity Grading:

1    Increased frequency or change in quality of bowel habits not requiring medication/ rectal discomfort not requiring analgesics 

2    Diarrhea requiring parasympatholytic drugs (e.g., Lomotil)/ mucous discharge not necessitating sanitary pads/ rectal or abdominal pain requiring analgesics 

3    Diarrhea requiring parenteral support/ severe mucous or blood discharge necessitating sanitary pags/abdominal distention (flat plate radiograph demonstrates distended bowel loops)

No diff in LRF (31-35%) or DM, or PFS. How do you explain this?
(1) a lower incidence of distant failure in complete responders and 
(2) a better salvage in the complete responders who later failed locally.

Role of surgical debulking for +PA nodes in Cervical CA

/SWB: /sidewall boost, /Parametrial boost.  Only for +PM or +Nodes.

Sup border: lower to mid SI join (to cover iliacs) (at least >1cm above tip of tandem)

Medial borders: 0.5cm lateral to ovoids. (100% isodose cloud line, or 50cGy or 150cGy (?) line)

or just 4-5cm wide rectangular block, sup border S2-3 (or just block all the way up)

Make sure tandem is not tilted.

Pelvic sidewall dose: 45-50Gy for microscopic disease, 55-65Gy for advanced dz. clinically involved nodes.

Eng: SWB to 5040 for uninvolved side, 5400 for involved side.

CM: SWB w/ +PM, known +nodes. 

Sidewall already gets PtB dose from brachy, which is 25% of PtA, if your doing 600x5, this is 150x5=750cGy, so give another 180 x 5 fractions = 900cGy.

Total 45+7.5+9=61.5Gy

 Now can we start doing IMRT for the pelvic part?

Then do /Brachy w/ SWB.

/Point A /PointA /PtA - tolerance of ureter

Classical Point A: originally defined by Manchester system:  Draw a line between top of both ovoids. From the intersection of this line on the tandem, go cephalad 2cm along tandem, then go out 2cm perpendicular to the tandem. 

Anatomically, Point A corresponds to the paracervical triangle in the medial edge of the broad ligament where the uterine artery cross the ureter 

Current definition of PtA: 2 cm above the "most inferior source" or "flange" and 2 cm perpendicular to the tandem.

/PtH - Nag says this is more consistent than PtA (from /Nag, Red 00, "S0360-3016(00)00497-1"): Draw a line connecting mid-dwell in the ovoids, go up along the tandem 2cm plus the ovoid radius.

Longer tandem allows more dose contribution from tandem so less dose in AP direction to bladder/rectum. (CM)

Tandem: 6-8cm. would like at least 6cm. Use straightest tandem possible so you don't curve over bladder, and get more dose to iliac nodes(?).

GOG in current trials is allowing a range of doses for HDR starting from 500x5.

600x5 is about equivalent to 40Gy of LDR (using Nag's formula w/ 0.55Gy/hr, mu=.46)

/Brachytherapy

/DoseRate, per ICRU 38, ICRU38 " A1121D 256264"

LDR <  2 Gy/hr  (<3 cGy/min) (usually 50cGy/hr or 10Gy/24h or 1 cGy/min)

HDR > 12 Gy/hr

Conversion factor 0.54-0.666 to go from LDR to HDR:

HDR = LDR * 0.6, or LDR = HDR/0.6

/LDR 

< 2 Gy/hr = 3.3cGy/min (ICRU38)  usually 1000cGy per day, 40-60 cGy/hr, 1 cGy/min.

CM: 2 LDR insertions of 40-48hrs each (36hrs if crappy implant), 

separated by 2 wks. 22Gy + 22Gy = 45 Gy of LDR.

(total dose 7000 cGy for H&N)

Pros: good for hypoxic cells (OER approaches 1), and good for slow growing tumors (redistribution). Better for large tumors, poor anatomy?

 Correction of acute hypoxia within LDR fraction. Correction of chronic hypoxia between fxs.

Cons: hospitalization, strict bedrest, Cs-137 availability, dose to staff, instrument immobilization.

Cesium sources are 20mm long. 5-6 mgRaEq/cm, at 1.0-1.5cm distance, 

For LDR, dose rate to PtA should be 40-45 cGy/hour, so total dose to PtA is 40-45Gy in ~96 hrs.

Standard loading: 15-10-10 in tandem, and 15 in med ovoids (10 if small, 20 if big ovoids).

Ovoids:

Small 2cm    10-15 mgRaEq

Med 2.5cm    15-20 mgRaEq

Large 3cm    20 mgRaEq

Limit vaginal surface dose to 120-140Gy (calculated geometrically)

/ICRU 38 "The bladder reference point is obtained"

ICRU 38 bladder dose point: Foley balloon 7cc radio-opaque fluid, pulled down against urethra.  On lateral, drop an AP line from center of balloon down to posterior surface of the balloon.  On AP, it's the center of the balloon.

ICRU 38 rectal dose point: 5mm posterior to vaginal packing, along an AP line drawn from the lower end of the intrauterine source (or between the intravaginal sources).

/HDR   

>12Gy/hr = 20 cGy / min

usually 100-200 cGy/min (same as EBRT). 

Iridium-192.

No real benefit for dose rate > 100 cGy/min (Hall, Fig 5.9)

Pros: shorter duration of treatment, outpatient, minimize dose to staff, can adjust dose cloud betw fx. Correction of chronic hypoxia betw fx

Cons: labor intensive, intense QA req's, not as effective for bulky tumors (Petereit) ??

HDR does not allow for normal tissue repair of late responding tissues.

Allow 48h between fx.

Viswanathan uses BED to convert to equivalent dose @ 2Gy/day (EQD2, Stefan Lung (?), Vienna LOOK THIS UP):

a/b 10 for tumor

a/b 3 for normal tissue

Use (1+d/(a/b))=1.2, or equivalent to 2Gy per fraction. 

Use large fx for melanoma (600BID) or sarcoma.

/PDR: Pulsed dose rate: has radiobiol adv of HDR, but takes place over prolonged fx time, requires hospitalization, nursing care. May be better than HDR for bulky >4cm??

Surveillance FDG-PET detection of asymptomatic recurrences in patients with cervical cancer.

Brooks RA, Rader JS, Dehdashti F, Mutch DG, Powell MA, Thaker PH, Siegel BA, Grigsby PW.

Abstract

OBJECTIVES:

To evaluate survival after detection of recurrent cervical cancer by FDG-PET in symptomatic versus asymptomatic patients.

METHODS:

This is a prospective registry study of 103 patients treated with definitive chemoradiation for advanced cervical cancer who demonstrated no abnormal FDG uptake (a complete metabolic response, CMR) on their 3-month posttherapy FDG-PET. Their median age was 48 years (range 26-84). The clinical stages were Ib in 38, IIa in 1, IIb in 39, and IIIb in 25. All patients underwent subsequent surveillance FDG-PET. Patients were grouped according to symptom status at the time of the surveillance FDG-PET. Recurrence sites and survival data were analyzed.

RESULTS:

The median time from the 3-month posttherapy FDG-PET to the first surveillance FDG-PET was 13 months. 25 patients (25/103; 24%) were symptomatic at the time of surveillance FDG-PET and 21 of these had FDG-PET findings indicative of recurrence. 78 patients (78/103; 76%) were asymptomatic and 9 of these had tumor recurrence detected by PET. All recurrences were confirmed by biopsy or radiologic progression. The recurrences in the 21 symptomatic patients were loco regional in 4 and distant in 17. The 9 asymptomatic patients had isolated loco regional disease in 8 and distant disease in 1. All patients received treatment for recurrence. The three-year cause-specific survival for symptomatic recurrences was 19% versus 59% for asymptomatic recurrences (p=0.09).

CONCLUSIONS:

Surveillance FDG-PET can detect asymptomatic recurrent disease that is potentially amenable to salvage therapy. Prospective investigation of surveillance PET is warranted.

Abstract

CONTEXT:

Retrospective studies have demonstrated that the use of positron emission tomography (PET) with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in the posttherapy evaluation of patients with cervical carcinoma is predictive of survival outcome.

OBJECTIVE:

To validate the association between the metabolic response on the 3-month posttherapy FDG-PET and long-term survival outcome.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS:

A prospective cohort study designed to validate our previous finding that the results of a 3-month posttherapy FDG-PET are predictive of long-term clinical outcome. A total of 92 women were treated with external irradiation, brachytherapy, and concurrent chemotherapy from January 2003 through September 2006. Posttherapy whole-body FDG-PET was performed 2 to 4 months (mean, 3 months) after completion of therapy.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:

The primary outcome end points were metabolic response, progression-free survival, and cause-specific survival.

RESULTS:

Posttherapy FDG-PET showed a complete metabolic response in 65 patients (70%), a partial metabolic response in 15 (16%), and progressive disease in 12 (13%). Their 3-year progression-free survival rates were 78%, 33%, and 0%, respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the hazard ratio (HR) for risk of recurrence based on the posttherapy metabolic response showing progressive disease was 32.57 (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.22-103.82). A partial metabolic response had an HR of 6.30 (95% CI, 2.73-14.56). These were more predictive of survival outcome than the pretreatment lymph node status (HR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.54-8.09).

CONCLUSION:

In this single-site study population of women with cervical cancer, 3-month posttherapy FDG uptake, as detected by whole-body PET, was predictive of survival.

Common iliac:  7-mm margin around vessels; extend posterior and lateral borders to psoas and vertebral body

External iliac: 7-mm margin around vessels; extend anterior border by additional 10-mm anterolaterally along iliopsoas muscle to include lateral external iliac nodes

Erickson doesn't give IVC but would like to.

Internal iliacs: go down to piriformis muscle

Inguinal LNs start at inguinal ligament, but hard to see on CT, so use top of femoral head.

May not be wise to spare rectum cuz of peri rectal nodes. especially for intact cervix.

Need to include Presacral nodes in cervical CA or Stage II endometrial:

Includes 1-2cm of tissue anterior to S1-3.

Go inferior until the piriformis muscle becomes clearly visible.

Vaginal contouring: Ideally, draw Vaginal contour on both bladder full and empty,  to account for daily variation of bladder filling. Fuse together to get ITV.

Include vagina and go lateral to medial edge of internal obturator muscle/ischial ramus on each side.  Maintain at least 15mm AP dimension. Mundt even includes 5mm of rectum.

Include upper 3cm of vagina or at least 1cm above obturator foramen.

Add 7mm sup, inf, and lat, and 5mm post to create PTV.

Is /IMRT ready for primetime for GYN?

post-op cervix: maybe

definitive cervix: probably not, due to large movements. WJK says no cuz we're not sure how much uterus we should treat, and by the time you treat whole uterus, then not really sparing much w/ IMRT.

WJK uses IMRT selectively for:

 ReRT

 Gross PALN or pelvic sidewall dz

 Boost for non-brachy candidates: Stage IVA cervical CA, invasion of bladder. 

   Wasn't a candidate for interstitial.

   Used IMRT to boost dz to 70-75Gy. (previously did max of 60-65Gy.)

 planar dose variability (vulvar)

 selected post-hysty cases if needed to reduce bowel DVH.

Adv of IMRT: better coverage, esp of common iliacs (sometimes they go all the way to L3), external iliacs.  spare small bowel.  not sure if you can spare bone marrow and small bowel at same time.

The median time to first relapse from the initiation of treatment was 8.4 months (range, 3.6-28 months). Most patients developed hematogenous distant metastases before their death. Only 2 of 15 patients who were treated with radiation therapy had a recurrence within the radiation fields. However, five patients had a recurrence above the radiation fields in the paraaortic lymph nodes, and two patients had a recurrence distal to the pelvic fields in the vagina. No patient had brain metastases as the sole site of first recurrence. However, two patients developed brain metastases concurrently with lung metastases. The overall survival rate was 29% at 5 years; none of the patients who had disease more extensive than stage IB1 or clinical evidence of lymph node metastases survived their disease.

Large Mexican trial enrolled 515 pts!

Gem arm also got adjuv Gem-Cis after RT.

Gem arm had better 3yr OS 78% v 69%, 3yr PFS 74% v 65%, TTP.

But Gem also had worse toxicities 86.5% v 46.3% (considered "acceptable").

Based on this, WJK says GOG is going to re-look at Cis-Gem combinations to see if can corroborate or refute this finding.

Abstract

BACKGROUND:

Anaemia associated with cancer and cancer therapy is an important clinical factor in the treatment of malignant diseases. Therapeutic alternatives are recombinant human erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) and red blood cell transfusions.

OBJECTIVES:

To assess the effects of ESAs to either prevent or treat anaemia in cancer patients.

SEARCH METHODS:

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2004. We searched the Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE and other databases. Searches were done for the periods 01/1985 to 12/2001 for the first review, 1/2002 to 04/2005 for the first update and to November 2011 for the current update. We also contacted experts in the field and pharmaceutical companies.

SELECTION CRITERIA:

Randomised controlled trials on managing anaemia in cancer patients receiving or not receiving anti-cancer therapy that compared the use of ESAs (plus transfusion if needed).

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS:

Several review authors assessed trial quality and extracted data. One review author assessed quality assessment and extracted data, a second review author checked for correctness.

MAIN RESULTS:

This update of the systematic review includes a total of 91 trials with 20,102 participants. Use of ESAs significantly reduced the relative risk of red blood cell transfusions (risk ratio (RR) 0.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.62 to 0.68, 70 trials, N = 16,093). On average, participants in the ESAs group received one unit of blood less than the control group (mean difference (MD) -0.98; 95% CI -1.17 to -0.78, 19 trials, N = 4,715). Haematological response was observed more often in participants receiving ESAs (RR 3.93; 95% CI 3.10 to 3.71, 31 trials, N = 6,413). There was suggestive evidence that ESAs may improve Quality of Life (QoL). There was strong evidence that ESAs increase mortality during active study period (hazard ratio (HR) 1.17; 95% CI 1.06 to 1.29, 70 trials, N = 15,935) and some evidence that ESAs decrease overall survival (HR 1.05; 95% CI 1.00 to 1.11, 78 trials, N = 19,003). The risk ratio for thromboembolic complications was increased in patients receiving ESAs compared to controls (RR 1.52, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.74; 57 trials, N = 15,498). ESAs may also increase the risk for hypertension (fixed-effect model: RR 1.30; 95% CI 1.08 to 1.56; random-effects model: RR 1.12; 95% CI 0.94 to 1.33, 31 trials, N = 7,228) and thrombocytopenia/haemorrhage (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.04 to 1.42; 21 trials, N = 4,507). There was insufficient evidence to support an effect of ESA on tumour response (fixed-effect RR 1.02; 95% CI 0.98 to 1.06, 15 trials, N = 5,012).

AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS:

ESAs reduce the need for red blood cell transfusions but increase the risk for thromboembolic events and deaths. There is suggestive evidence that ESAs may improve QoL. Whether and how ESAs affects tumour control remains uncertain. The increased risk of death and thromboembolic events should be balanced against the potential benefits of ESA treatment taking into account each patient's clinical circumstances and preferences. More data are needed for the effect of these drugs on quality of life and tumour progression. Further research is needed to clarify cellular and molecular mechanisms and pathways of the effects of ESAs on thrombogenesis and their potential effects on tumour growth.
