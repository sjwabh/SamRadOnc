The real question is whether LVSI predicts higher pelvic (non-cuff) failures even after adequate LANectomy.

LUS involvement does not appear to be an independent risk factor for pelvic or vaginal recurrence. (Phelan, GO 2001, 83:513)

vag cuff: Why are we trending away from both Pelvic+VC for Stage I?

/Randall Red 19:49, 1990

Stage I

Pelvic RT +/- VC

157 pts

Increased rectal bleeding complications 18.6% v 3.8%.

Should we do VC boost for locally advanced EAC?

From GOG 0258: 

If there is tumor extension into the vagina, the external beam fields will be

modified to include the disease volume with at least a 2 cm margin. For

involvement of the distal 1/3 of the vagina, inguino-femoral nodes should also

be covered in the external beam RT ports. If the patient’s tumor extends into

the cervix, or invades deeply and extends into the lower uterine segment, or if

there is lymph-vascular space invasion by tumor, or if the tumor has extended

into the vagina, such a patient will receive intravaginal boost brachytherapy

(HDR or LDR) at the discretion of the radiation oncologist.

/Schink (ASTRO 2010)

2 types of EAC

Type I: obesity, comorbidities, should re-direct to focus on their health, they often die of comorbidities.  Need to do "safest" surgery.

Type II: clear cell, UPSC, even uterine sarcoma

 die of their recurrences.

Schink says:

half of pts w/ +LNs die of distant disease.

Doing another trial of ESS (a la ASTEC) still not going to prove benefit.

ESS is a poor biomarker which does not improve survival.

Should spend more effort studying type 2 EAC.

e.g., /Lynch Syndrome (HNPCC)

Represents 2% of EAC. mean age younger.  might be more aggressive, but not proven.

Sentinel cancer is EAC (51%) more often than Colon CA (49%)!!

usually right-sided Colon CA.

WJK: VC 7Gy x 3 to 5mm, treats upper 2/3 vagina (inferior border is 1-1.5cm below pubic symphysis on AP radiograph, which is usually about 5-6cm).  But on Fx 3, only treat upper 2-3cm!

650 x 4 Schray: treats entire vagina.  to 5mm to upper half, to surface to lower half.

Viswanathan (BWH) has proposed  4Gy x 6 to reduce vaginal stenosis:

Townamchai, A Novel Low Dose Fractionation Regimen for Adjuvant Vaginal Brachytherapy in Early Stage Endometrial Cancer, GynOnc 2012, doi:  10.1016/j.ygyno.2012.07.111
/Small has changed vag cylinder dosing to more fractions to reduce vaginal stenosis since 7Gy to 5mm is >10Gy at surface.

RTOG /0818 DOESN'T REALLY EXIST

01/2008 Dr. Bill Small updated the group on cancer control protocol RTOG 0818 evaluating different schedules of vaginal brachytherapy. Dr. Small indicated the prescription point would likely be the vaginal surface and most likely there will be three fractions of vaginal brachytherapy versus six fractions of vaginal brachytherapy. The primary endpoint of this trial will be vaginal shortening.

VAG CUFF BOOST after pelvic EBRT

400x3 to 5mm (Nag ABS)

500x1 to 5mm (WJK)

700x3 is only 29.7Gy LDR equivalent.  (Need 70-75Gy LDR equivalent) However, you have to remember that this dose is being prescribed to 5 mm depth along the sides of the vaginal cylinder.  The apex is getting a higher dose, usually approximately twice the dose as the prescription dose.

In general, the dose at a 5-mm depth is only 50% to 65% of the dose at the vaginal surface.

From Yashar 2009 ASTRO Review:

Both ASTEC and CONSORT found LN+ rate to be 9-10%

(pts were not excluded if enlarged nodes on imaging)

But both found no OS diff.

But LANectomy may help guide therapy (VC vs whole pelvic EBRT)

Endometrial Stage III, IV, with <2cm residual disease.

RCT of chemo vs WART

WART 30Gy + Pelvic Boost 15Gy = 45Gy

422 pts (21% were UPSC)

Chemo AP (Doxo/ Cisplat) better 5yr OS 55% v 42% (HR .68) than WART.

But neither arm did very well: Any pelvic failure was 13% (WART) v 18% (AP).

Pelvic or Abdominal Failure Rate in Chemo arm: 30% (?)

And higher acute toxicities in chemo arm and only 2/3 completed chemo.

The high local failure rates suggest a continued role for RT, but maybe not WART.

Critiques: No stratification by risk factors (histology, substage, dz volume), chemo was toxic, RT was subotimal wouldn't expect to control 2cm of disease (but 87% had no gross dz). 25% had stage IV.

RT Details: pelvic EBRT 48.6Gy (45Gy was allowed for 1/3 of sites)

The estimates for 5-year OS are 70% for the C-RT arm versus 73% for the CT arm. 

The CTV included the proximal vagina, parametrial tissues, and internal, external, and common iliac up to L5–S1.

The CTV was extended to include the aortic bifurcation if ext/int iliac lymph node involvement;

to include the lower peri-aortic region for common iliac node involvement;

and to include the higher para-aortic region in case of para-aortic involvement (with a superior margin of ≥2 cm above the highest involved lymph node)

If complete bilateral lymphadenectomy had been done with at least 12 lymph nodes,

it was recommended to have the upper border at the iliac bifurcation.

In case of cervical involvement (glandular, stromal, or both), a brachytherapy boost was given to the vaginal vault. Recommended HDR dose: 5Gy (5mm) x 2.

Most patients were treated with a four-field technique;

use of IMRT was allowed for centres per approval.

Chemo details: cis 50 during weeks 1 and 4, then carbo/Taxol q3wks x 4

Endpoints OS, FFS

Conclusion: Addition of chemo helped FFS but not OS.

Comments: lymphadenectomy was optional, more than 1/3 did not get surgical staging(?)

Vaginal and pelvic control was high with radiotherapy in both groups.

The treatment duration was longer in the chemoradiotherapy group than in the radiotherapy group,

and significantly higher rates of adverse events were reported in the chemoradiotherapy group during, and in the first year after, treatment.

doi: 10.1016/j.clon.2017.01.009.

PMID: 28209456

Abstract

AIMS:

To summarise and evaluate the current literature in gynaecological tumours treated with stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) through a systematic review using the Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

A literature search through Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane databases resulted in 22 pertinent manuscripts. Selected studies evaluated the locoregional role of SABR in gynaecological tumours, regardless of SABR clinical indication. Data on local control, toxicity and SABR dose and technique were extracted by at least two investigators.

RESULTS:

In total, 330 patients received locoregional SABR for gynaecological tumour and had measurable clinical outcomes. Six different clinical scenarios were identified: (i) boost to external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for cervical cancer as radical treatment; (ii) boost to EBRT for non-operable endometrial cancer; (iii) treatment for pelvic and/or para-aortic node metastases; (iv) adjuvant treatment after surgery in uterine/cervix cancers; (v) salvage of non-nodal pelvic recurrences and (vi) vulvar or vaginal malignancies. Except for SABR as a boost for non-operable endometrial cancer, local control over 80% was found in a range of median follow-up of 4-132 months. Local control in non-operable endometrial tumours receiving SABR was 53%. In salvage treatments for non-nodal pelvic relapses, SABR was associated with about a 20% grade 3-4 gastrointestinal toxicity.

CONCLUSION:

There is no clear consensus or evidence on the defined role of SABR in gynaecological tumours. Local control and toxicity associated with SABR seems reasonable for most clinical indications found by this review with a short median follow-up. When used for salvage of non-nodal pelvic recurrences, SABR may be associated with high rates of grade 3-4 late gastrointestinal toxicity.

From 2009 to 2015, 47 lesions from 28 patients were treated with SABR 

Primary cancer diagnoses were 15 ovarian, 8 endometrial, 2 cervical, 2 vaginal, and 1 uterine carcinosarcoma. 

Target locations were 17% liver, 21% lung, 17% paraaortic node, 26% other node, and 19% pelvic soft tissue. 

Mean ± standard deviation pre-SABR tumor diameter was 24 ± 22 mm.

Dose: median of 5 fractions to a median total dose of 40 Gy

After treatment, 34% of targets were stable (SD), 32% had a partial response (PR), 17% had a complete response (CR), and 17% had progressive disease (PD). 

 Lesions that responded favorably were also more likely to have received a higher biologically effective dose (79.0 vs 59.6 Gy, P = 0.027)

1 patient experienced grade 3 toxicity.

Devita2004: "Pure uterine sarcomas of the homologous type arise from native elements, as is seen in ESS, LMS, and sarcomas of nonspecific supporting tissues (fibrous tissue, vessels, lymphatics). Heterologous sarcomas may contain elements with nonnative differentiation, such as skeletal muscle, bone, and cartilage.155 The malignant mixed müllerian tumor is a combination of carcinoma and sarcoma and is now termed carcinosarcoma. Although any combination is possible, serous carcinoma admixed with endometrial stromal sarcoma is the most common histologic type. The adenosarcoma is a rare mixed tumor in which a benign epithelial component is mixed with a sarcomatous element."

Uterine Sarcoma Tx: surgery (& pelvic/pa LND for MMMT only). No clear role for RT. Sequential RT then chemo could be considered (some reports show RT may improve LC but not survival) in select cases.

Conclusions: Our study corroborates GOG 150 results, and shows that paclitaxel-carboplatin appears to be an efficacious adjuvant chemotherapy regimen for completely resected uterine carcinosarcoma. The role of adjuvant RT in addition to chemotherapy warrants further investigation.

The management of uterine sarcomas continues to present many difficulties. Primary surgery /vcis the optimal treatment but the role of post-operative radiation remains uncertain. In the mid-1980s, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Gynaecological Cancer Group Study proposed a trial to evaluate adjuvant radiotherapy, as previous non-randomised studies had suggested a survival advantage and improved local control when post-operative radiation was administered. The study opened in 1987 taking 13 years to accrue 224 patients. All uterine sarcoma subtypes were permitted. Patients were required to have undergone as a minimum, TAH and BSO and wahsings (166 patients) but nodal sampling was optional. There were 103 leiomyosarcomas (LMS), 91 carcinosarcomas (CS) and 28 endometrial stromal sarcomas (ESS). Patients were randomised to either observation or pelvic radiation, 51 Gy in 28 fractions over 5 weeks. Hundred and twelve were recruited to each arm. The initial analysis has shown a reduction in local relapse (14 versus 24, p=0.004) but no effect on either OS or PFS. No unexpected toxicity was seen in the radiation arm. No difference in either overall or disease-free survival was demonstrated but there is an increased local control for the CS patients receiving radiation but without any benefit for LMS. Prognostic factor analysis shows that stage, age and histological subtype were important predictors of behaviour which may explain differences between CS and LMS. CS appears to show more kinship to poorly differentiated endometrial carcinomas in behaviour. LMS did not show the same benefit from radiation. These results will help shape future management and clinical trials in uterine sarcomas.

They couldn't determine benefit for ESS, too few cases.

Adjuv Pelvic RT decr pelvic recurrences.

2 SEER analyses on survival in CS: One says yes, one says no.

Wright, Am J Obstet Gynecol. 2008

In a multivariate model, adjuvant radiation reduced the risk of death by 21% in women with carcinosarcomas (hazard ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.7-0.9). Radiation reduced mortality rates in patients with carcinosarcomas who had not undergone node dissection but had only a marginal effect on survival in node-negative women. Adjuvant radiation had no effect on survival for early-stage leiomyosarcomas (hazard ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.9-1.4). CONCLUSION: Adjuvant radiotherapy improves survival for select patients with early-stage carcinosarcomas but is of limited value for leiomyosarcomas.

Nemani, GO 2008

Lymphadenectomy is significantly associated with improved overall survival in patients with Stage I-III uterine carcinosarcoma compared to no lymphadenectomy. The use of adjuvant radiotherapy conferred no overall survival benefit.

/LMS - Then she gave me [uterine] leiomyosarcoma and I said "I would just do a hysterectomy and I will not do any pelvic node dissection."  She asked "why?"  I said "because the risk of lymph node is less than 3% and I will not do radiation because the most common pattern of failure for [uterine] leiomyosarcoma will be distant failure to the lung."

Correlations Between Radiation Dose in Bone Marrow and Hematological Toxicity in Patients With Cervical Cancer: A Comparison of 3DCRT, IMRT, and RapidARC.

Chang Y1, Yang ZY, Li GL, Li Q, Yang Q, Fan JQ, Zhao YC, Song YQ, Wu G.

OBJECTIVE:To comparatively evaluate the hematological toxicity (HT) associated with 3 concurrent chemoradiotherapies that are routinely used to treat cervical cancer, including 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT), intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), and RapidARC and to establish a new normal tissue complication probability model of bone marrow (BM) to predict HT in cervical cancer patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

METHODS:

Patients with cervical cancer (N = 100) who received concurrent cisplatin and whole-pelvic radiotherapy were enrolled in this study. Dosimetric parameters (including V10, V20, V30, and V40 and mean doses to the pelvic bone) and HT were analyzed.

RESULTS:

The V20, V30, and V40 and mean doses to the BM were lower in the IMRT and RapidARC groups than in the 3DCRT group, and the RapidARC group had higher V10 and V40 and mean values than the IMRT group. The V20, V30, and V40 and the mean dose to the pelvic bone were positively correlated with HT. Generalized linear normal tissue complication probability models of white blood cell (WBC) and absolute neutrophil cell (ANC) nadirs and BM V20 were established as follows: WBC nadir = 3.382 - 4.056 • V20 + 0.295 • baseline of WBC (adjusted R = 0.246, F = 15.847) and ANC nadir = 2.438 - 2.780 • V20 + 0.233 • baseline of ANC (adjusted R = 0.236, F = 16.282).

CONCLUSIONS:

This study suggests that IMRT results in milder hematological toxicity than either 3DCRT or RapidARC. Dosimetric parameters were associated with the incidence of HT in cervical cancer patients who received concurrent chemoradiotherapies.
