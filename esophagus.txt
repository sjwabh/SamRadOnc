Smoking and EtOH are risk factors for SCC

GERD is risk factor for adenoCA

267 pts, esoph CA

Phase III

Conclusion: PFS was equivalent, ~9.4-9.7 months.

Also no significant differences between groups in any of the secondary endpoints of overall survival, proportion of endoscopic complete responses, time to treatment failure, or occurrence of grade 3 or 4 toxicities. 

FOLFOX was a less time-consuming and easier to administer regimen.

Has implications for the potential use of FOLFOX combination in cisplatin-intolerant patients.

Stahl M, Walz MK, Stuschke M, et al., J Clin Oncol 2009;27:851-6.

Phase III comparison of preoperative chemotherapy compared with chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction. 

In the POET trial, only patients with esophagogastric-junction tumors were included and randomly assigned to preoperative chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. In that study, there was a nonsignificant trend in favor of preoperative chemoradiotherapy.

Definitive CRT (50Gy + 5FU / cisplatin x4) vs RT (64Gy)

Improved 5 yr OS: 26% v 0%

Improved LC 55% v 30%.

But still 45% LRR after CRT. :(

And 70% locoregional recurrence w/ just RT!  :(

SCC (21%) did better than AdenoCA (13%).

High-Dose (64.8) vs Conventional-Dose (50.4) RT in Definitive CRT.

5FU / cis x 4 cycles.

No benefit.

Comments: high Dose arm actually did worse! 13 mo for 64.8, vs 18 mo for 50.4.

Critique: High mortality in the High Dose arm, but they died before even reaching 50Gy!

 

 

But JH/PS treat cervical esophagus like H&N: 65-70Gy

JCOG9907

Recently, a JCOG study (JCOG9907) demonstrated significantly

better overall survival after preoperative

chemotherapy with two courses of cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil

followed by surgery compared with postoperative

chemotherapy for resectable cStageII/III thoracic squamous

cell esophageal cancer.2 Since publication of the

results of the JCOG9907 study, preoperative chemotherapy

followed by radical esophagectomy has been accepted as

the standard therapeutic approach to resectable cStage II/III

esophageal cancer in Japan.

 

Ajani wrote a critique: one major point of criticism is that in the postoperative treatment

arm, pathologically node-negative patients did not receive

chemotherapy because a previous RCT comparing postoperative

chemotherapy vs. surgery alone (JCOG9204) did

not show any benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in pathologically

node-negative patients.

/Tylosis: nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma: AD genetic disorder chr17, hyperkeratosis of palms/soles, oral leukoplakia, esoph papillomas, 37% increased risk esoph SCC.

 

 

/Achalasia: absent Auerbach's (myenteric) ganglion (/Hirschsprung of rectum: both submucosal [Meissner’s] and myenteric plexus [Auerbach’s] are missing) 

(then v VIP ? causing constriction of LES) of esophagus.

Sx: At night, vomit up food.

      incr risk of esophageal CA

      smooth narrowing of GE jcn

      Dysphagia to cold solids and liquids.  (easier to swallow hot solids)

      Can also be acquired from T. cruzi (Chagas, reduviid bug)

Tests: Bird's beak on Ba study.

Rx: balloon dilatation

esophageal spasm - Ca blockers

 

/Zenker's (false) Diverticulum - posterior herniation of cricopharyngeus muscle between mucosa & submucosa, in upper esophagus.

Women, 80-90's

Sx: dysphagia, halitosis, food comes out nose, voice change, aspiration

Tests: Ba swallow

 

/esophagectomies

 

transthoracic esophagectomy: is the best oncologic surgery

   R thoracotomy (Ivor-Lewis): for mid or upper

   L thoracotomy: Left for lower or GEJ, cuz stomach on left

 

transhiatal esophagectomy: enter from below diaphragm, pull stomach up

  may not be as good cuz can't see LNs as well, but leaks easier to manage.

 

/nodes, Esophageal: Need at least 15 LNs removed.

 

 

/Her2 in /adenoCA, esoph

Approximately 7 to 22 percent of esophagogastric adenocarcinomas overexpress the type II epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR2,HER2), a similar percentage to that seen in breast cancer.

Higher incidence in esoph (25%) than gastric?

Assoc w/ worse prognosis in gastric and esoph

The benefit of trastuzumab in advanced HER2-positive adenocarcinoma of the stomach or EGJ was addressed in the phase III ToGA trial, which compared standard chemotherapy (six courses of cisplatin plus either infusional FU or capecitabine) with and without trastuzumab (8 mg/kg loading dose, then 6 mg/kg every three weeks until disease progression.

 

Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial.

Lancet. 2010;376(9742):687.

594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18.6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.60-0.91; p=0.0046)
