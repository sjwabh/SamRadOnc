/COMS study “NCT00000124”, eye plaques comparable survival to enucleation:

12-yr FU (Arch Ophthalmol. 2006)

5 yr all cause mortality 20%

10 yr all cause mortality 35%

12 yr all cause mortality 41-43%

5yr death w/ mets 10%

10 yr death w/ mets 17-18%

12 yr death w/ mets 17-21%

Median Survival 7 yrs.  

Mets to liver & bone.

QoL results: Arch Ophthalmol. 2006 "124:226-238"

Better Vision in Brachy pts up to 2 yrs out, but then by yrs 3-5, about the same as enucleation.

More anxiety in Brachy pts for a longer time (!).

"Although by 4 to 5 years posttreatment the observed

treatment-related differences in the primary outcomes had

largely disappeared, the early differences favoring brachytherapy

may be important considerations for patients faced

with choosing a therapeutic approach. Given that no significant

differences in survival between enucleation and

brachytherapy have been found, these results will allow

the individual patient and physician to make more informed

choices regarding treatment based on personal

preferences with respect to visual function, anxiety and

concern about cancer recurrence, and appearance."

RT: I-125 episcleral plaque to 85-100 Gy.

Mewis and Young12 listed four indications for the use of external-beam radiotherapy in the treatment of metastatic breast carcinomas to the eye: (1) secondary retinal detachment, (2) decrease in visual acuity, (3) threat to decrease visual acuity, and (4) rapidly enlarging tumor. Using these criteria, 52 of 66 affected eyes with follow-up data available underwent irradiation. The visual acuity of these patients remained stable in 67.3%, improved in 26.9%, and deteriorated in only two eyes. One eye did not have a posttreatment visual acuity evaluation. Treatment consisted of 25 to 30 Gy with a lateral portal in 10 fractions.

    Numerous publications document the ability of external-beam radiotherapy to successfully treat ocular metastasis effectively.18-32 Response rates in these series ranged from 33% to 89%, with the majority in the 80% range. In most of these studies, vision either improved or stabilized in a high percentage of patients.18-32

    Rudoler et al30 recently reported a multivariate analysis of 188 patients treated with external-beam radiotherapy for choroidal metastasis. The median total dose of radiotherapy was 36 Gy with a range of 30 to 40 Gy in 2 to 3 Gy fractions. The treated volumes include the unilateral posterior globe in 33% of patients, bilateral posterior globes in 22%, the entire globe in 30%, and the whole brain plus the posterior globes in 15%. Following radiotherapy, 57% of all eyes had improved visual function or were able to maintain at least navigational vision. Of 47 eyes that were legally blind before radiotherapy, 21% improved to excellent vision and 15% to navigational vision at last follow-up. Ninety-three percent of patients remained free of clinically evident recurrent disease at last follow-up, with a 98% rate of globe preservation. Four patients were enucleated after radiotherapy for intractable pain from glaucoma.

Conventional fields:

Single or Opposed Laterals using a D-shaped field with half beam block shielding the anterior half of the orbit, positioned 2-3mm behind canthus, 1cm margin around orbit.  Treat to 35-40Gy??

PS:

single lateral field, 6x photons

D shaped clinical setup: 5cm x 5cm

A: bony canthus

250x14=35Gy

/ocular lymphoma

WORKUP: Brain MRI, sample CSF

Needs chemo, maybe intrathecal, then treat orbit 20-45Gy IMRT

/orbital lymphoma, or conjunctival MALT lymphoma

Salmon colored lesion on conjunctiva.

For conjunctival MALT: Test for Chlamydia psittaci.  

  If +, Doxycycline x 2 weeks.

  If -, 6e- en face w/ bolus

  conjunctival MALT 24Gy

For Lacrimal gland, wedged pair (AP & Lat)

  MALT: 30Gy

  DLBCL: RCHOPx3 then IFRT 30-36Gy

  

RT dose: 30Gy for low grade, 40Gy for med/high grade.

Electrons, or IMRT.

Opposed laterals for bilateral orbits.

lens block?

/Bhatia, Red 2002 ("PII S0360-3016(02)02966-8")

RT dose: 30Gy for low grade, 40Gy for med/high grade.

LC 100%!!!!!!

5yr OS 74%

5yr RFS 66%

PS says there's another study of orbital DLBCL of 30Gy v 40Gy, that says that 30Gy is enough.
