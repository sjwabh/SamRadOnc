Surgery (subtotal gastrectomy, splenectomy, omentectomy, LND), then PostOp CRT w/ 5FU/LV if T2 or greater.

 

Extent of LND (#Nodes: need at least 15 nodes resected)

D0:

D1: perigastric nodes

D2: .. and celiac, splenic, portal/common hepatic. (Preferred, but worse morbidity, no diff in outcome?)

D3: ... Add +splenectomy, omentectomy, distal pancreatectomy

D4: ...para aortics

 

 

/Dumping Syndrome - rapid gastric emptying after gastrectomy or vagotomy: abd pain, bloating, diarrhea, vasomotors sx (tachycardia, lightheadedness), hyperinsulin->reactive hypoglycemia

 

Malabsorption

  B12, Ca, Fe

 

 

/Gastric Dose:

RT Dose: APPA 45 Gy.

 

Cautious boosts to 55, maybe.

RT Dose: 45-52 Gy, with cone down if you’re going over 45.

OAR: Must exclude 2/3 of 1 kidney. liver, heart, lung.

Do DVH of heart.

/Gastric Fields

APPA

SI: T10-L3

R: 3-4cm lateral to vertebral body.

AP Field from RTOG 9904:

Superior Border - will be at the T8-T9, or T9-T10 interspace (to treat the celiac axis, GEJ, gastric fundus, and dome of diaphragm).

Inferior Border - the L3-L4 interspace (to cover the gastroduodenal nodes and gastric antrum).

Right Margin - will be 3-4 cm lateral to the vertebral body (to encompass the porta hepatis, gastric

antrum, medial duodenal wall, and gastroduodenal nodes). If the distal stomach is involved the entire

circumference of duodenum should be included in the field for > 5 cm beyond gross disease.

Left Margin - sufficiently lateral to include 2/3 - 3/4 of the left hemidiaphragm (to include the gastric

fundus, splenic and suprapancreatic nodes, and left hemidiaphragm in proximal T3 lesions).

 

 

Nodal areas at risk include: the gastric and gastroepiploic, celiac, porta hepatis, subpyloric, gastroduodenal, splenic-suprapancreatic, and retropancreaticoduodenal nodes. The splenic hilum, porta hepatis, and usually celiac track can be identified on CT scan. The celiac axis will usually arise at approximately T12-L1 level. The porta hepatis

nodes are ordinarily encompassed by a field 2cm to the right of the T11-L1 vertebral bodies, however, the lateral and cephalocaudal location can be quite variable and should be determined from CT scans. The remaining branches of the celiac axis are treated by a field including the stomach and the medial portion of the duodenal C loop. The C loop of the duodenum usually extends to the lower margin of L3.

 

 

 

May consider laterals for boost, but hard to avoid kidneys.

 

Nodes to cover (depending on location)

ALWAYS:

peri gastric

Celiac

SMA

 

PROXIMAL

splenic

suprapancreatic?

 

DISTAL

Porta hepatis - 4cm to the right of T11-L1

/Gastric studies

 

MacDonald, SWOG /9008, INT /0116. NEJM 2001;345:725-30., "Texas at San Antonio, San Antonio (J.M.J.)."

(Updated ASCO 2004)

For IB or greater Gastric or GEJ (20% were GEJ)

Chemo: 5FU 425mg/m2/d x 5d, / LV 20m/m2/d x 5d

Chemo x 1 cycle, then ChemoRT for cycles 2-3, then 2 more cycles of chemo.

RT: APPA 45Gy

PostOp CRT improves OS by 9 mos (35 mos v 26 mos).

(These pts had more advanced stage disease than in MRC, Dutch studies (>62% T3, >86% N+)

3yr OS 50% v 41%.

UPDATE: 5yr OS 40% v

3yr LRC 70% v 50%

Adjuv CRT had most effect on improving LRF.

BUT No diff in DM.

 

Breakdown of tumor locations:

Cardia 20%

Body

Antrum (mostly)

 

Criticisms:

How many got D1 vs D2?

<D1 54%

D1 36%

D2 10% (only 10% got D2!, but this was documented post-hoc, perhaps only by #nodes removed)

 

Median LNs removed: 6 (inadequate, need at least 15 for AJCC N staging)

 

Central Review of RT was critical: 35% of plans got corrected before treatment.

 

/DVH Stomach

Kidney: Keep 2/3 of each less than 20Gy, or whole kidney <18Gy

Liver: V30<60% 

Heart: V40<30% (pericarditis)

 

Korean retrospective study showed postop CRT still improves 5yr OS 57% v 51% even for D2 resected gastric CA. (Kim, IJROBP 2005)

 

D1 vs D2: 2 studies showed no diff in OS:

 

Japanese study showed D2 do better?

 

Dutch study D1 vs D2

Bonenkamp, NEJM 99

No OS diff

45-47% 5yr OS for D1 or D2 alone (no adjuvant)

And D2 had higher morbidity and more post-op deaths (10% v 4%).

 

MRC study D1 vs D2

Cuschieri BJC 99

No 5yr OS diff: 35% vs 31%

 

/ARTIST trial, Lee, JCO 30:268-273, 2012. "DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2011.39.1953"

Gastric

PostOp CRT vs PostOp Chemo

RT 45Gy.

Chemo: Xeloda / cis.

Negative trial. No DFS or OS diff.

Unplanned subset analysis of N+ showed a TREND (p=.08) toward improved DFS for N+ only.

Too few deaths to see OS diff.

  

 

/MAGIC trial by British MRC, "ISRCTN93793971"

Cunningham, NEJM 2006

500 pts, Gastric, Lower Esophagus (14%), or GEJ (11%)

For resectable Stage II or higher.

Pre- & Post-op chemo (ECF x3) vs surgery alone for gastric.

/ECF - epirubicin, cisplatin, fluorouracil

41% had a D2 resection!

Improved 5yr OS (36% v 23%), PFS. 

Also decreased tumor size, downstaged, #nodes,

Didn't improve R0 resectability rate, No pathCR.

So pre-Op chemo is good.

 

Comparison: INT 0116 had more advanced tumors, MAGIC had higher D2 rate (41% v 10%), but INT 0116 still had better outcomes in control arm at 2 yrs.

 

MAGIC2: PreOp Chemo +/- Bevacizumab.

 

 

Do we really need PostOp RT for Gastric?

CRITICS Study (Netherlands)

There's a new Netherlands trial currently underway that is comparing

ECX x3, D1 surgery, ECX x3

ECX x3, D1 surgery, chemoRT (CX + 45Gy)

X=Xeloda.

 

 

CALGB 80101: Compares 2 postop chemoRT regimens.

For resected high-risk gastricCA.

PostOp CRT: infusional ECF vs CI 5FU/LV

(ECF x1, 5FU/RT, ECF x2) vs

(5FU/LV x1, 5FU/xRT, 5FU/LV x2)

ECF=epirubicin/CDDP/5FU

Still accruing in 2006.
