/EMPD  /Paget’s disease of Vulva - intraepithelial adenoCA usually arising in apocrine glands or Bartholin's gland.

Epid: older, postmenopausal Caucasian women.

Sx: eczematoid, red, weeping, pruritic.

Only 5-10% of vulvar Paget's have underlying adenoCA. (Unlike Paget's breast, which is invariably (80-98%) associated with an underlying ductal carcinoma).

About 30% will develop an adenoCA at another location: MC in breast, colon, rectum, and the upper female genital tract.

poor prognosis factor in EMPD is having dermal invasion or metastasis via the lymphatic system (rare).

WJK:

Early Stage: can use surgery (WLE, MRV, RV)

Locally Advanced: unable to resect w/o ultra radical or exenterative surgery.

Salient Issues:

Nodal mgt
 adjuv nodal RT
 prophy nodal RT (if no GND)

Adjv therapy for primary site

Groin nodes are primary predictors of failure and survival.

Metachronous groin node failure almost uniformly non salvageable. (Stehman 1996).

But most local vulvar recurrences are salvageable (Stehman AJOG 1996)

/Vulvar Treatment:

Eifel: EVERYBODY gets yeast infxn during RT, which can be confused with RT Dermatitis.  If you see erythema at 20-30Gy, start on Fluconazole and sometimes Bactrim.

WLE for IA-III

IB or greater: always needs full GND. But Koh thinks sometimes you can skip groin dissection and do prophylactic groin RT if done carefully. See GROINSS-VII.

If well lateralized, start w/ ipsi GND. If ipsi pN+, then needs contra GND.

PORT for vulva PRIMARY Indications (I-II): (45-50Gy, boost to 60Gy for +M)
 <8mm margin
 >5mm deep and LVSI
 Size>4cm and LVSI

/Dusenbery: If you're gonna treat the groins, might as well treat the primary.
Dusenbery, Red 1994, 29:989-998, U Minn, 27pts retrospective
...says don't do big midline vulva block. vulva relapse rate 49%. If you're treating the groin, include the primary!

"She asked if I would treat just nodes and not the primary.  I said no, I would include the primary site.  She asked why?  I said Dusenberry described a very high vulvar failure rate with the use of a central block.  She smiled and said, “This is my third day of examining and you’re the first person to mention KD’s paper.""

Majority of vulvar relapses are still salvageable... (WJK had a ref, but Eifel doesn't always believe this).

If groin cN0, risk of groin pN+ is 20% per Stehman GOG88.

If groin cN+, risk of pelvic N+ is 28% per Homesley GOG37.

If ipsi groin pN+, risk of contra N+ is 25% per Homesley GO 1992.

/PORT for groin / pelvis indications
 2 or more path + groin nodes
 single grossly positive cN+
 +ECE (60-66Gy per Eifel)
 1+LN and <5 LNs resected (NR>20%)

(WJK) Kunos: NR>20% does worse.

What about contralateral dissected groin that's negative? Skip contra groin RT. (WJK)

/Jackson, IJGC 2006
20 pts
Stage III/IV
Tried ipsi groin RT only.
Didn't find contra failures.
So WJK uses this as a basis to do ipsi groin RT only.


What about prophy contralateral undissected groin?  prophy 45Gy

25% of pts w/ lateralized lesions and ipsi GN+ will have contra GN+ also. (Holmesley GO 1992)

For groin, PET has Negative Predictive Value of 86%, sensitivity 67%.(Cohn, Gynecol Onc 2002, "doi:10.1006/gyno.2002.6605")

WJK does prophy dose of 45-50Gy

How to manage pelvis? WJK never does ipsi pelvis.

PostOp Concurrent /chemo?
No phase III data, but extrapolate from other gyn sites.
Koh says maybe Add chemo for 3+LNs, or ECE.





Treatment for /ADVANCED vulva, stage III,IVA

For locally advanced vulvar CA: (but there are no large RCTs)

PreOp CRT (5FU / mitoC OR weekly cisplatin) to 45Gy, then if CR then take primary and +N to 60Gy, wait 6 wks, surgery.  But if <CR @ 45Gy, then go straight to surgery w/ B LND, then maybe still RT Boost.

/GOG101 (Moore et al, Montana et al, Red 1998)

Unresectable Vulvar, T3-T4 or N2-N3

PreOp Split Course chemoRT w/ 5FU / Cis, then resection & B groin LND

47.6Gy @177/d, split course

~50% CR rate

OS 55%

Of T3-T4, 46% had cCR, and of these pCR in 70%.

Of N2-N3, 38 of 40 became resectable, pCR in 15/37.

Goal: can we reduce scope of surgery?

WJK:

Be careful of in-transit mets from primary to groins.  Can't do discontiguous, use big fields.

WJK still recommends surgery even if cCR after CRT. Different from anal CA.

GOG205 (successor to GOG101)

Increase dose to 57.6Gy

Goal: increase pCR rate

What about definitive CRT for early stage vulvar if medically inoperable?  Not standard of care.

/Vulva Fields:

Sim: supine, frog leg. Wire LN, vulva, anus, scars.

Borders:

Sup: mid or inferior SI joint. or L5-S1 if +groin or +pelvic LN.
Inf: flash vulva, 3cm below ischium

Randomized to Pelvic LND vs pelvic/groin EBRT.
PostOp Groin & pelvic nodes to 45-50Gy
Originally in Ob Gyn 1986,
Study closed early cuz RT showed advantage in LC and OS.

RT better 2yr Survival 68% v 54%.
In pelvic LND arm, 28% had pelvic LN+.
If pelvic LN+, survival very poor (20% ish)
9% vulvar failure rate at primary site.
25% groin failures in surgery alone arm (almost all were fatal),
5% groin failiures in RT arm.
Post-hoc subset analysis:
Found 2 poor prognostic factors:
1) clinically palpable (formerly cN2-3)
2) 2 or more path positive groin nodes

Conclusion: Should use Pelvic RT to control pelvic LNs if +groin.

6-yr Update in Obst Gyn 114: 2009:

Now, 6-yr OS, RFS, no longer significantly different, but this was probably cuz of other causes.  

Still, 6-yr cancer-related survival still significantly favors RT.

Also, for the 2 poor prognostic factors above, 6yr OS still favors RT.

New poor prognostic factor: >20% nodal ratio in ipsi groin is worse for every outcome measure.

Conclusion: Pelvic RT still better for 6-yr CANCER-RELATED survival, and if you have 1 of 2 of the poor prognostic factors.

Most benefit for clinical palpable or 2+ path+ nodes.

Most benefit is for the groins.

No increase in lymphedema (20%) in either arm. (WJK doesn't believe this tho, poorly reported.)

Also for +ECE? (per MRC)

Next, can we skip groin dissection altogether in cN0 since it's so morbid?

How do you address the groin, if not obviously positive?







/Stehman /GOG88, Red 1992: RCT of Groin dissection vs Groin RT, "0360-3016J92"

For IB-III, cN0.

RT arm had 50Gy prescribed to 3cm depth to B inguinals only, 50% of dose given w/ electrons to spare femoral heads (no pelvic RT).

Surgery arm got full B Radical LND if inguinal pN+, also got PORT 50Gy to groin & pelvis.

Closed early due to excess groin relapses in RT arm.

Results:

20% of pts actually had +groin nodes.

18.5% failure in RT arm, vs 0% in surgery arm.

Criticisms:

No CT staging.

Subclinical dz is not the same as microscopic disease.

RT prescribed only to 3cm depth. No pelvic RT.

Surgery arm also got pelvic LND if +inguinals, and also got PORT to inguinals & pelvis if +.

But despite the serious criticisms, because of the Stehman paper, we still do LND first if cN0, and then add groin PORT if (2 or more +N, +ECE, ...

/Minimum LNs resected for vulvar:  10.

Both Koh and Eifel wrote papers in 1992-93 criticizing that this RT was insufficient.

Koh thinks sometimes you can skip groin dissection and do prophylactic groin RT if done carefully.

Levenback et al. [84] reported the results of

a prospective multicencer validation study (GOG 173), which

was a phase III study of intraoperative lymphatic mapping in

patients with invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.

A total of 452 patients with squamous cell carcinoma with at

least 1 mm invasion and 2 cm ≤tumor size ≤6 cm, but without

groin LNs suggestive of cancer was entered into the protocol

and underwent intraoperative lymphatic mapping, SLN

biopsy, and inguinal femoral LND. One hundred thirty three

patients showed LN positivity, including 11 (8.3%) with falsenegative

LNs. Of note, however, 23% of true-positive patients

were detected only by immunohistochemistry. The sensitivity

was 91.7% (90% lower confidence bound, 86.7%) and false

negative rate was 3.7% (90% upper confidence bound, 6.1%),

which was further decreased to 2.0% in women with tumor

<4 cm. This suggests that women with primary tumors <4 cm

who met the eligibility criteria for this trial can be preoperatively

counseled that if SLN is negative, the groin relapse risk

due to a false-negative SLN would be less than 3%. Accordingly,

they concluded that SLN biopsy could be a reasonable

alternative to inguinal LND in selected women with vulvar

cancer.

Vaginal Tx:

Stage I: EBRT + intracavitary and/or interstitial brachy.  5yr LRC is 80%. 5yr OS 70-95%

Stage II+:

Concurrent chemoRT for locally advanced or recurrent.

Use T&Cylinder for vaginal CA < 5mm

Use interstitial or IMRT for vaginal CA > 5mm.

Lateral vaginal wall: use interstitial (& intracavitary?).

Vaginal RT Doses:

EBRT 45Gy, then Brachy (for superficial apical tumors, 50-60Gy LDR brachy over 72hrs

)

Dose: 75-85Gy brachy

But if can't cover w/ brachy, use IMRT or conformal 3D.

Probably better to give 65Gy EBRT, rather than only 45Gy to partial w/ brachy.

HDR: Syed 600x3 prescribed to volume.

6 needles in obturator, more needles around.  Try for at least 5-6 needles.

Prescribe to the GTV + 1-1.5cm margin.

Tx Complic: vaginal stenosis!

Eifel (ASTRO 08), Vagina:

Upper Vagina: For conventional fields, sup border L5-S1.

Lower Vag: inguinals

Brachy boost:

source moves w/ pt.

Best for small discrete lesions.

Can go to higher doses. 85Gy.

EBRT for poorly defined, large, adjac to critical structures, but most consider organ motion, can only go to about 70Gy, but better to give this dose to whole lesion, rather than partially to 85Gy and partially to 60Gy.

Vaginal motion:  can move up to 2 inches, mostly cuz of bladder filling.

Always sim w/ both full and empty bladder to eval motion of vagina.

May need  to use daily Foley w/ fixed amount of 150-200cc.

For a 3cm cylinder, 1cm from surface dose falls from 50Gy to 18Gy.

May need a new MRI after EBRT before brachy.

Can't use intracavitary for >5mm thick tumors.

Interstitial: for upper tumors, always use laparoscopy.

Upper: use template

If tenting needles seen in peritoneum, ask GynOnc to cover this w/ omentum to protect bowel.

Suburethral, or Lateral Wall: do freehand.

superficial posterior lesions: most challenging. Intracavitary (Miami) cylinder w/ peripheral needles. Use fiducials to mark extent of lesion pre and post EBRT.

Also may need posterior interstitial needles.

For superior posterior lesions, use rectal balloon, need daily IGRT. Started w/ IMRT, then interstitial.

To keep needles straight.

Use dental rolls taped together, or cut out specimen cup.

Use lead shielded vaginal cylinder to shield anterior vagina.

Dose: 75-85Gy using brachy.

vaginal studies:

        serous (die by apoptosis),

          papillary serous

          serous cystadenocarcinoma (MC)

        mucinous - May rarely be associated with pseudomyxoma peritoneii. CA 125 levels may not be markedly elevated. Relatively chemoresistant. Differential diagnosis of a mucinous ovarian tumor includes metastatic disease from an appendiceal primary.  Better prognosis?

        endometrioid - Sometimes associated with endometriosis or an independent uterine cancer of similar histology. May occur with early stage disease in younger patients, although advanced disease is also possible.

          clear cell - most chemoresistant type of ovarian cancer. Often contains “hobnail” cells  

Germ cell (10%)

Sex cord stromal (5%)

Poor Prognosis: clear cell, mucinous

Sx: peritoneal carcinomatosis

Ovarian Staging

I: Confined to ovaries

IA: 1 ovary

IB: 2 ovaries

IC: surface, ruptured capsule, or malignant peritoneal washings

II: Pelvic implants

IIA: implants on uterus or tubes, no malignant peritoneal washings

IIB: implants on other structures, no malignant peritoneal washings

IIC: implants with malignant peritoneal washings (5yr OS 71%)

III: Extra-pelvic peritoneal implants

IIIA: microscopic

IIIB: macroscopic <2cm

IIIC: macroscopic >2cm OR +Regional LN

IV: Distant mets

Rx:

Surgery, w/ maximum cytoreduction.

For IC or G3, II-IV:  Adjuv Chemo.

Paclitaxel/ Cisplatin (GOG 158)

Follow CA-125 after treatment. /CA125 /CA-125 normal range < 35

20% of ovarian cancer pts never have elevated CA 125 levels.

Only about 3% of women with elevated CA 125 levels have ovarian cancer.

Other conditions that cause an increased CA125:

Malignancies: uterine tubes, endometrium, lung, breast, pancreas, and gastrointestinal tract.

Benign:  pregnancy, endometriosis, uterine fibroids (benign tumors), pancreatitis, normal menstruation, pelvic inflammatory disease, and liver disease. Benign tumors or cysts of the ovaries can also cause an abnormal test result.

/WART for ovarian CA (see Hansen Ch30): Role for adjuvant RT appears minimal at this time

WART Fields: S: above diaphragm, I: bottom of obturators, Lat: outside peritoneal reflection but spare strips.

WART Dose: 30Gy at 1.5Gy/d, block kidneys at 15Gy, block liver at @25Gy, Boost pelvis/PA to 45Gy.

Adjuvant whole abdomen RT was shown to be superior to single-agent chlorambucil combined with pelvic RT in a Princess Margaret randomized study published in 1979

Subsequently, two Princess Margaret randomized studies have evaluated the technique, one comparing a moving strip technique to open beam technique (showing comparable results but better toxicity with open beam technique) and the other comparing two dose regimens (WAI 22.5 Gy vs. WAI 27.5 Gy, with no difference in outcomes)

Other similar subsequent randomized trials have not shown a difference in survival or disease control

to be continued ...

Chiara, Italian Trial, 1994:  69 patients with ovarian cancer, stage IA-B/G3 and IC-II, were randomized to WART 30.2 Gy + WPRT 43.2 Gy vs. Chemotherapy alone with CDDP 50 mg/m2 and Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 q 4 weeks x 6 cycles.  Results: 5-yr OS

WART 53

CTX alone 71

This trial prematurely closed due to poor accrual and inadequate protocol compliance, skewed distribution with 25 patients receiving RT and 44 patients receiving chemotherapy.

Conclusion - CDDP-based chemotherapy improved OS.

Whole abdominal RT was removed as a treatment option from NCCN guidelines in the 2007 version
