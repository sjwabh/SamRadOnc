http://www.hepatitisc.uw.edu/go/management-cirrhosis-related-complications/liver-transplantation-referral/calculate-meld-score

From UpToDate:

The MELD equation that is currently used by UNOS for prioritizing allocation of deceased donor livers for transplantation is demonstrated below:

MELD = 3.8*loge(serum bilirubin [mg/dL]) + 11.2*loge(INR) + 9.6*loge(serum creatinine [mg/dL]) + 6.4

With this model, scores can range from negative values to infinity. However, to avoid confusion, UNOS modified the MELD scoring system to eliminate negative values by setting to 1.0 any measured laboratory values that were less than 1.0. Thus, patients with the combination of an INR of ≤1, serum creatinine ≤1 mg/dL, and serum bilirubin ≤1 mg/L will receive the minimum score of 6 MELD points. In addition, UNOS set an upper limit for the MELD score at 40 points.

In an effort to avoid an unfair advantage for patients with intrinsic renal disease, the maximum serum creatinine level was set to 4.0 mg/dL, which is also the value that is automatically assigned to patients on dialysis. There is currently no modification in the score for patients receiving anticoagulation.

Sequential phase I and II trials of stereotactic body radiotherapy for locally advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.

PURPOSE: To describe outcomes of prospective trials of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). 

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two trials of SBRT for patients with active HCC unsuitable for standard locoregional therapies were conducted from 2004 to 2010. All patients had Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A disease, with at least 700 mL of non-HCC liver. The SBRT dose range was 24 to 54 Gy in six fractions. Primary end points were toxicity and local control at 1 year (LC1y), defined as no progressive disease (PD) of irradiated HCC by RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors). 

RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were evaluable (Trial 1, 2004 to 2007: n = 50; Trial 2, 2007 to 2010: n = 52). Underlying liver disease was hepatitis B in 38% of patients, hepatitis C in 38%, alcohol related in 25%, other in 14%, and none in 7%. Fifty-two percent received prior therapies (no prior sorafenib). TNM stage was III in 66%, and 61% had multiple lesions. Median gross tumor volume was 117.0 mL(range, 1.3 to 1,913.4 mL). Tumor vascular thrombosis (TVT) was present in 55%, and extrahepatic disease was present in 12%. LC1y was 87% (95% CI, 78% to 93%). SBRT dose (hazard ratio [HR]= 0.96; P = .02) and being in Trial 2 (HR = 0.38; P = .03) were associated with LC1y on univariate analysis. Toxicity≥grade 3 was seen in 30% of patients. In seven patients (two with TVT PD), death was possibly related to treatment (1.1 to 7.7 months after SBRT). Median overall survival was 17.0 months (95% CI, 10.4 to 21.3 months), for which only TVT (HR = 2.47; P = .01) and being in Trial 2 (HR = 0.49; P = .01) were significant on multivariate analysis. 

CONCLUSION: These results provide strong rationale for studying SBRT for HCC in a randomized trial. abujold.hmr@ssss.gouv.qc.caPMID23547075

Abstract

We retrospectively evaluated the local tumor control and safety of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) followed by stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for small hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in this pilot study.

Twenty-eight patients not for the indication of hepatectomy or ablation procedures were enrolled in this study. Eligible criteria was as followed: i) less than 3 hypervascular HCC nodules, each up to 30 mm in diameter; ii) not suitable for the hepatic resection or ablative therapy; iii) Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) score < or = 7. SBRT was performed within 1-2 months after TACE. Treatment efficacy was evaluated, according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Cancer of the Liver (RECICL).

The median local tumor control time was not reached. The 1-year cumulative local tumor control rate was 96.3%. The median disease-free survival time was 18 months. The 1- year cumulative overall survival rate was 92.6%. One patient (3.6%) died due to intrahepatic ectopic multiple recurrence and systemic metastasis and one (3.6%) due to cerebral hemorrhage. No patients experienced severe acute hematologic or physical toxicity or radiation induced liver damage.

Our study demonstrated SBRT combined with TACE is a safe and effective modality of the locoregional therapy for small primary HCC.

RILD Radiation-induced liver disease after stereotactic body radiotherapy for small hepatocellular carcinoma: clinical and dose-volumetric parameters.

On univariate analysis, Child-Pugh class was identified as a significant clinical parameter, while normal liver volume and normal liver volumes receiving from < 15 Gy to < 60 Gy were the significant dose-volumetric parameters. Upon multivariate analysis, only Child-Pugh class was a significant parameter for predicting grade 2 or worse RILD.

To analyze the long-term survival and tumor control outcomes after stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for metastases limited in number and extent.
METHODS AND MATERIALS:
We prospectively analyzed the long-term overall survival (OS) and cancer control outcomes of 121 patients with five or fewer clinically detectable metastases, from any primary site, metastatic to one to three organ sites, and treated with SBRT. Freedom from widespread distant metastasis (FFDM) was defined as metastatic disease not amenable to local therapy (i.e., resection or SBRT). Prognostic variables were assessed using log-rank and Cox regression analyses.
RESULTS:
For breast cancer patients, the median follow-up was 4.5 years (7.1 years for 16 of 39 patients alive at the last follow-up visit). The 2-year OS, FFDM, and local control (LC) rate was 74%, 52%, and 87%, respectively. The 6-year OS, FFDM, and LC rate was 47%, 36%, and 87%, respectively. From the multivariate analyses, the variables of bone metastases (p = .057) and one vs. more than one metastasis (p = .055) were associated with a fourfold and threefold reduced hazard of death, respectively. None of the 17 bone lesions from breast cancer recurred after SBRT vs. 10 of 68 lesions from other organs that recurred (p = .095). For patients with nonbreast cancers, the median follow-up was 1.7 years (7.3 years for 7 of 82 patients alive at the last follow-up visit). The 2-year OS, FFDM, and LC rate was 39%, 28%, and 74%, respectively. The 6-year OS, FFDM, and LC rate was 9%, 13%, and 65%, respectively. For nonbreast cancers, a greater SBRT target volume was significantly adverse for OS (p = .012) and lesion LC (p < .0001). Patients whose metastatic lesions, before SBRT, demonstrated radiographic progression after systemic therapy experienced significantly worse OS compared with patients with stable or regressing disease.
CONCLUSIONS:
Select patients with limited metastases treated with SBRT are long-term survivors. Future research should address the therapeutic benefit of SBRT for these patients.

Department of Radiation Oncology, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY 14642, USA. alan-katz@urmc.rochester.edu

METHODS AND MATERIALS:
The records of 69 patients with 174 metastatic liver lesions treated with SBRT between April 2001 and October 2004 were reviewed. The most common primary tumors were colorectal (n = 20), breast (n = 16), pancreas (n = 9), and lung (n = 5). The mean number of lesions treated per patient was 2.5 (range, 1-6). The longest diameter of the lesions ranged in size from 0.6 to 12.2 cm (median, 2.7 cm). Dose per fraction ranged from 2 Gy to 6 Gy, with a median total dose of 48 Gy (range, 30-55 Gy). Dose was prescribed to the 100% isodose line (IDL), with the 80% IDL covering the gross tumor volume with a minimum margin of 7 mm.
RESULTS:
The median follow up was 14.5 months. Sixty patients were evaluable for response based on an abdominal computed tomography scan obtained at a minimum of 3 months after completion of SBRT. The actuarial overall infield local control rate of the irradiated lesions was 76% and 57% at 10 and 20 months, respectively. The median overall survival time was 14.5 months. The progression-free survival rate was 46% and 24% at 6 and 12 months, respectively. None of the patients developed Grade 3 or higher toxicity.
CONCLUSION:
Hypofractionated SBRT provides excellent local control with minimal side effects in selected patients with limited hepatic metastases.

/Incidental finding after ccy:

. If the tumor is T1b or greater or the margins of resection are positive and if no metastatic disease is present on evaluation (CT or MRI scan and chest radiograph), then a second surgical resection is required. This additional surgery should include partial hepatic resection and regional lymphadenectomy (porta hepatis, gastrohepatic ligament, and retroduodenal lymph nodes). A bile duct resection may also be necessary, depending on tumor size and location. If the original surgery was performed via a laparoscopic approach, then the port sites should also be resected to avoid tumor seeding.

Need thorough LANectomy of porta hepatis, try for at least 6 nodes.

From UpToDate (9/2015):

Locally unresectable and recurrent disease — Between 50 and 90 percent of patients with cholangiocarcinoma present with locally unresectable disease [3]. The prognosis for patients with locally unresectable or locally recurrent disease is typically measured in months, and their lives are characterized by rapid decline with symptoms of progressive biliary obstruction. The goals of palliative therapy are relief of symptoms (pain, pruritus, jaundice) and improvement in quality of life.

There is no role for tumor debulking in these cases. Conventional dose EBRT (with or without systemic chemotherapy) may relieve pain and contribute to biliary decompression [4-7]. At one year, 60 to 75 percent of patients are free of locoregional disease progression, and median survival approximates 7 to 12 months [7,8]. However, local failure remains the first site of disease progression in 50 to 75 percent of cases.

Higher dose RT approaches that use either a combination of transcatheter brachytherapy plus EBRT, three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT), or intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy may be associated with better local control and possibly prolonged survival [9-21]. As an example, in a series of 128 patients with unresectable hepatobiliary malignancies (46 with cholangiocarcinoma), 3D-CRT (median dose 60.75 Gy in twice daily 1.5 Gy fractions) directed only to the liver abnormalities was combined with concurrent intrahepatic artery floxuridine (0.2 mg/kg per day) [19]. Sixty percent of all patients were free of hepatic progression at three years, and the median survival was 13.3 months.

PostOp RT for Bile Duct CA: There may be more of a case for adjuv RT for Bile Duct CA than gallbladder CA cuz more LR alone in BD than GB.  GB tends to have more distant failure.

For resectable, post-op CRT.

R1 microscopic tumor left (RT helps)

R2 cut through tumor

Crane: Margin status most important where tumor abutted SMA.

/pancreatic Tx for

/unresectable pancreatic CA

From UpToDate:

Local unresectability is usually (but not always) due to vascular invasion, particularly of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) (figure 2). Although practice is variable across institutions, many surgeons would consider a pancreatic cancer to be locally advanced and unresectable if it is associated with encasement (more than one-half of the vessel circumference) of the SMA or celiac artery, occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) or SMV-portal vein confluence without suitable vessels above and below the tumor to allow for reconstruction.

For unresectable, Crane says use small fields, don’t go after distant nodes cuz unlikely that nodal RT will improve survival, probably only adds toxicity (GI toxicity, fatigue).

Just do tumor bed +/- close regional nodes (celiac, SMA).

Murphy, Red 2007: Only 5% of failures were in regional nodes.

(Moertel GITSG)

Crane:

New unresectable regimens: Gem, then consolidation CRT (Xeloda/RT)

For unresectable pancreatic CA, use GEM!

Blackstock says "Gemcitabine has been std of care for 8-9 yrs."

/Burris, 1997 Jun;15(6):2403-13, PMID 9196156

RCT

Gem improves pain, PS, weight, but only modest diff in Median OS: 5.65 mo vs 4.4 mo.

Avastin doesn't help (per CALGB 80303), but MDACC doing another Phase I trial of Bev + CRT.

T4 Borderline resectable (defined as 180 degrees or less of arterial abutment)

(PreOp RT helps the most for these cases!)

Concurrent CRT (Gem).

Focus high dose to arterial abuttment margin.

Integrated boost 2.25Gy/Fx to arterial margin, and to enlarged LNs. The rest goes to 50.4-55.

Crane showed small series of 12 pts, 4 went on to resection w/ neg margins.  8 found to have distant mets.

Unresectable (Crane, MDACC method):

Gem x 4 mos, CT, if no mets, chemoRT (CI 5FU).

from Ben-Josef, Maui 2010:

Structure Constraints

Kidney

Liver Minimize NTCP (or mean dose <30Gy)

Stomach &

Small Bowel Max dose ≤54Gy; 2% of the volume can be between 50 and 54Gy, 25% of the volume can be between 45 and 54Gy

Spinal cord Max dose ≤45Gy

Duodenum Max dose ≤60Gy; not more than 33% of the volume can be between 45 and 60Gy

Koong (Stanford) is now doing SBRT for unresectable pancreas.  About 33.5Gy in 5 fx.  Fractionating has lower incidence of duodenal toxicity than single fraction.  Start with a cycle of gem, then do SBRT during the 1 week off.  Better LC (~90%?) and more convenient for pt.

/Pancreatic studies

/adjuvant /postop /post-op pancreatic CA:

Crane: PostOp doses: 50.4 to tumor bed and regional LNs, and 63Gy to gross dz.

Be careful to limit jejunal reconstruction to 50.4 Gy.

Should we still do adjuvant chemoRT?

Maybe for high risk factors:  pathologic lymph node status, surgical margin status, and CA 19-9 level as being among the most important.

Conclusion: If your post op CA19-9 < 90, and tumor is in HoP, and you follow the 9704 protocol for RT, even better survival than CONKO (slightly).

High local failure rate of 62% implies inadequate surgery and/or RT?

 higher LF rate in RT arm (fluke of randomization?)

CRT arm survival even worse than control arm, suggesting either fluke of randomization, or excess deaths from CRT toxicity, but we're not seeing that w/ current techniques.

RT arm having worse survival may suggest RT toxicity, but actually their LF rate was higher (do we actually know this?), a fluke of randomization?

study accrual done in 2 diff ways (2x2 crossover design or 3-way), randomization wasn't always blinded(?), short FU, 33% did not receive all chemo.

RTOG 0848, the successor study to RTOG 9704, is a phase III trial that is attempting to answer two questions, the first being whether there is a survival benefit for adding erlotinib to gemcitabine compared to gemcitabine alone among head of pancreas patients who have undergone either an R0 or R1 resection. The second question is whether the addition of CRT in patients who have no evidence of disease progression following a full course of gemcitabine is superior to full course of gemcitabine alone. The results of RTOG 0848 will be critical to shedding light on the role of CRT, and until they are available we have no choice but to look to published literature from the modern era to guide our clinical practice.

can be divided into three clinically distinct subtypes: main duct type, branch duct type and mixed type.

Although this tumor usually shows a slow evolution and a low malignancy rate, all gradations from benign adenoma to in situ or invasive carcinoma can be encountered.

It has been reported that the branch duct type IPMT is less invasive and has a better prognosis than the main duct type IPMT.[6-11] Therefore, an aggressive surgical approach has mainly been recommended for IPMT with diffuse involvement of the main pancreatic duct.
