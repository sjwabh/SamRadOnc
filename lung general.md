Limitations of PET/CT in the Detection of Occult N1 Metastasis in Clinical Stage I(T1-2aN0) Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer for Staging Prior to Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy.

The negative predictive value for positron emission tomography-computed tomography in patients with clinical stage T1 versus T2 tumors was 72 (96%) of 75 versus 25 (83%) of 30, respectively (P = .03), and for peripheral versus central tumor location was 77 (98%) of 78 versus 20 (74%) of 27, respectively (P = .0001). The negative predictive values for peripheral T1 and T2 tumors were 98% and 100%, respectively; while for central T1 and T2 tumors, the rates were 85% and 64%, respectively.

Concluded that should do pathologic nodal staging ESPECIALLY for central or T2 tumors.

Older notes:

For Central or N1, ALWAYS NEED Bx confirmation.

FP 15%

FN 24-30% (so always need bx)

 

For Peripheral primary (OK if PET-):

FP 15%

FN 3-6%

/EBUS now thought to be as accurate as mediastinoscopy.  EBUS does better at staging than PET.

EBUS can get to levels 2,4,7,10,11.  Can't get to 5,6,8,9.

  Procedure risks: bleeding, ptx

 

Esophageal EUS for 5,7,8,9. (for lower lobe tumors)

  FEV1>1.0 threshold for RT. 

  FEV1>1.2 or FEV1<40% is considered “medically inoperable”.

  DLCO<60 also sometimes used. DLCO is measure of gas exchange.  Reduced in ISLD. Dsb is a technique “single breath” for measuring DLCO. Must be adjusted for lung volume (D/VA) and Hct (Dsb (adj)).

The authors were able to stratify patterns into three groups to augment statistical power and found that overall survival, disease-specific survival, and disease-free survival were all improved in lepidic-predominant (pattern 1) tumors in comparison with acinar-predominant (pattern 2) tumors and that survival in both of these tumor patterns was better than for pattern 3 (papillary, micropapillary, and solid tumors).

LEPIDIC PATTERN:

 A single layer of pulmonary adenocarcinoma cells may spread along the expanse of alveolar surfaces without invading alveolar septal stroma in a pattern of growth that has come to be referred to as lepidic because of its vague resemblance in cross-section to a butterfly. Furthermore, this process is commonly multifocal.

Sublobar resections in stage IA non-small cell lung cancer: segmentectomies result in significantly better cancer-related survival than wedge resections.

Studies investigating survival after sublobar resection of stage IA NSCLC should always distinguish between anatomical segmentectomies and wedge resections.

/targeted agents for lung CA (also see MISC)

EGFR is mutually exclusive with ALK, KRAS

For Lung CA, Kaiser does reflex sequencing in this order:

 KRAS>EGFR>ALK FISH>ROS1 LUNG CA REFLEX

/KRAS for NSCLC (mostly adenoCA (25%), smokers, non-Asians). KRAS+ has poorer prognosis.

KRAS+ shows worse response to RT.

/KRAS : Activating KRAS oncogenic mutations are detected in a wide variety of cancers including 30-45% of colorectal carcinoma, 25-35% of lung adenocarcinomas and 60-90% of pancreatic cancer. Presence of KRAS mutation in most tumor types is associated with adverse prognosis as well as resistance to receptor tyrosine kinase-directed targeted therapies, including against EGFR.

 Haven't found any good targeted agents for KRAS+.

/EGFR for NSCLC (usually adenoCA (micropapillary, BAC (lepidic)), non-smokers, females, Asians (50%) )

  Tarceva (erlotinib), afatinib (cetux is independent of EGFR status)

/EGFR-TKIs (small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors): (oral)

EGFR mutations are present in 10% to 15% (10-30%) of NSCLC in the United States.

EGFR mutations are also most commonly seen in adenocarcinomas, and are rare in neuroendocrine carcinomas (including SCLC) or mucinous carcinomas.

More common in female patients, never-smokers, and patients of Asian ethnicity.

(overexpressed in 60-70% (85%)?????? NSCLC, mostly in SCC(??adenoCA)

(overexpressed in 80-100% of H&N CA)

Better response in Asians, females, never smokers.

There is also strong preclinical evidence that EGFR inhibition is additive or synergistic with radiotherapy in NSCLC.  Main toxicities are hematologic and GI bleeding.

Erlotinib and Gefitinib Offer Similar Benefit in EGFR-Mutated Non–Small Cell Lung Cancer

April 2014 - Volume 9 - Issue 4 - p 506–511

Cancer and Leukemia Group B 30106 and a multi-institutional Australian phase I trial have shown that gefitinib can be added to concurrent chemoradiotherapy for stage III NSCLC without excessive toxicity. A phase I trial at the University of Chicago (Chicago, IL) has evaluated erlotinib with concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC.

RTOG 0324 is an on-going phase II trial studying cetuximab and concurrent chemoradiotherapy in stage III NSCLC.

/Iressa (/gefitinib) by AstraZeneca

EGFR-TK, was for Advanced NSCLC, but (SWOG S0023 12/04) showed WORSE OS for NSCLC,

But works well in Asian female never smokers w/ BAC w/ high EGFR expression.  

Develops resistance over time...

Maybe now use gefitinib for esophageal, better for Esoph SCC.

Side Effects: DIARRHEA, skin rash

/ALK for NSCLC (mostly adenoCA (2-7%), non-smokers)  (TKI)

ALK rearrangements are most common in patients with pulmonary adenocarcinomas who are either never-smokers or light smokers.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EML4-ALK_positive_lung_cancer

NCCN now says do Broad Molecular Profiling on every non-SCC lung CA...

For lung SCC:

/FGFR1 amplification (in 20% of lung SCC):  It is a membrane receptor tyrosine kinase that regulates cell proliferation through activation of the MAPK and PI3K pathways 

/PTEN: Mutations of PTEN occur only rarely in about 5% of NSCLC (113) being more common in SCC than ADC (10.2% vs. 1.7%) and associated with a history of smoking. 

It is a negative regulator of the PI3Kinase pathway.

May be targeted with PI3K inhibitors.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphoinositide_3-kinase_inhibitor

Lung adenocarcinoma patients with Asian descent have higher incidence of EGFR mutations than that of European descent [23]. Presence of mutation was also correlated with smoking status & gender [24,25]. It has been seen that non-smoker NSCLC patients have much higher incidence of mutations in EGFR gene than smokers [24,25]. It has been observed that the mutations are profound in non-smoking individuals (about 6.5 times higher) than smokers, 4.4 times higher in adenocarcinoma than other sub class of NSCLC, 1.7 times higher in females than males and 27–60% East Asians (compared to Europeans 8–13.3%) [26,44]

74 Gy radiation given in 2 Gy fractions with concurrent chemotherapy was not better than 60 Gy plus concurrent chemotherapy for patients with stage III non-small-cell lung cancer, and might be potentially harmful. Addition of cetuximab to concurrent chemoradiation and consolidation treatment provided no benefit in overall survival for these patients.

RCT of +-consolidative TRT after chemo in ES-SCLC

For pts who got any response after four to six cycles of standard chemotherapy.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation and thoracic radiotherapy preferably had to start within 6 weeks, but not later than 7 weeks after chemotherapy, and not within 2 weeks after chemotherapy or if acute grade 2 or higher toxic effects of chemotherapy had not yet resolved.

Most also completed PCI about 1 week before starting TRT.

Prophylactic cranial irradiation was given as 20 Gy in five fractions, 25 Gy in ten fractions, or 30 Gy in ten, 12, or 15 fractions.

+-TRT was 300x10

" Hilar and mediastinal nodal stations that were considered involved pre-chemotherapy were always included, even in case of response. "

Results:

495 pts

No diff in 1yr OS (33% v 28%).

Improved 2yr OS 13% v 3%

Improved 6mo PFS 24% v 7%

Decreased thoracic recurrences by 50%.

/PLAN /ES-SCLC (PCI & TRT)

For ES-SCLC patients who obtain a response to chemotherapy, we recommend consideration of both prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) and consolidative thoracic radiotherapy, after the completion of all chemo.

Regarding PCI for ES-SCLC, the EORTC 08993 trial (Slotman, EORTC 08993, New England Journal of Medicine. 2007;(357), pp 664-72) showed that PCI reduced the risk of symptomatic brain mets 15% v 40% at 1 yr, and improved 1-yr OS 27.1% vs 13.3%.

Regarding consolidative thoracic RT for ES-SCLC pts, the Dutch CREST trial (Slotman, Lancet 2015, Jan 3; 385:36) showed that thoracic RT decreased thoracic recurrence by 50%, and improved 6-month progression free survival 24% vs 7%, and improved 2-yr overall survival, 13% vs 3%.

Improved DFS.

Mildly increased toxicity.

New immuno for early stage NSCLC:
Over the past several years, FDA has approved two drugs as post-surgical, or adjuvant, treatment in people with early-stage NSCLC. They include osimertinib (Tagrisso), which is approved for patients whose tumors have mutations in the EGFR gene, and the immunotherapy drug atezolizumab (Tecentriq), which is approved for use in patients whose tumors have increased levels of the immune checkpoint protein called PD-L1.

/PD-L1 /PDL1  overexpression in NSCLC 

PD-L1 can be expressed by both tumor and inflammatory cells within the tumor microenvironment, though the relative importance of either is unclear.

... in the KEYNOTE-010 study presented at the 2016 American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting, the percentage of patients with  more than 50 percent PD-L1 expression in archival (456 patients) and new samples (578 patients) was very close (60 percent vs 55 percent).

/Hellman, MedOnc, MSKCC, said in 2016: “Now PD-L1 testing should be done routinely and is becoming the standard test to determine first-line treatment.”

 (Opdivo, approved in December 2014 and March 2015 for non-squamous and squamous NSCLC in the 2nd line setting) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda, approved in October 2015 for PD-L1 positive NSCLC also in the 2nd line setting).  

Also Yervoy (ipilimumab). 

“Nivolumab, with or without ipilimumab, was recently added to the NCCN guidelines for [recurrent] small cell lung cancer based on data from the CheckMate-032 study.   But don't need to test PD-L1 in SCLC because..the biomarker is not nearly as predictive for patients with SCLC.

So far, it appears that both anti-PD-1 antibodies, as well as the therapeutic anti-PD-L1 antibodies in development, will have comparable efficacy and toxicity, with responses in approximately 15–20 % of unselected NSCLC patients and serious autoimmune toxicities in 5–10 % of patients. 

The role of PD-L1 testing is largely prognostic for patients beginning treatment with either nivolumab or pembrolizumab given that none of the assays can conclusively identify non-benefiting patients. 

 In the absence of head-to-head to comparisons or clear biological differences between these agents, it is not possible to recommend one treatment over another. (/Grigg, J Immunother Cancer. 2016; 4: 48.

After 6 months, lobectomy had best OS and DSS for all pts, and for fit pts.

In propensity score matching of SABR vs other techniques, SABR & lobectomy had statistically similar OS, DSS, although survival curves (Fig 2) show lobectomy survival curve slightly better.

Even for age>65, lobectomy OS better than sublobar resection, probably due to better pt selection, improved techniques (VATS).

Caveats: Most SABR pts did not undergo path nodal evaluation to confirm stage I disease, so stage migrration may account for slightly inferior SABR outcomes.

/LungART trial
https://www.thelancet.com/article/S1470-2045(21)00606-9/fulltext
Preliminary results of the phase 3 randomized LungART trial (NCT00410683) were recently presented at a virtual ESMO conference. 501 patients with pathologically confirmed N2 NSCLC s/p complete resection were randomized to postoperative RT (54 Gy) or observation. Almost all patients received chemotherapy (95%) and 91% of patients were staged with PET-CT. Median follow-up was 4.8 years. The risk of a mediastinal relapse was less with postoperative RT (46% vs 25%) but this did not translate to a significant increase in disease-free survival. DFS at 3 years was 47.1% with RT versus 43.8% with no RT. The HR was 0.85 (95% CI 0.67-1.07, p=0.16). OS at 3 years was 66.5% with RT versus 68.5% with no RT. Slightly higher rates of cardiopulmonary toxicity were noted in patients receiving RT (Annals of Oncology 2020;31:S1178).
primary endpoint: 3yr DFS 47% v 44%
Median DFS 30.5 v 22.8 mos 
5% rate of G3+ RP
11% rate of G3+ cardiopulmonary toxicity
Two pts died from RP



current NCCN guidelines, I have generally recommended postoperative RT in patients with pN2 NSCLC. 



/PORT Indications for NSCLC: +M or N2 only. 

MENTS

  +M or gross residual (if can’t re-resect)

  ECE

  N2 disease only?  +Nodes: Hilar N1 or greater disease (peribronchial N1 is OK)

  (or only for multiple or bulky LN, ECE)

  T4

  SCC (my prediction model says NO BENEFIT for AdenoCA)
 

Timing, Sequencing of PORT for NSCLC:

 

If M-, chemo x 2-4c, then mediastinal RT 50.4Gy (as per ANITA, Keller(?)).

If M+, RT or CRT first, then chemo. (per RTOG 9705?)

 
 

PORT Technique for Stage I, II:

Keep volumes small, just treat mediastinal areas that had disease.

Treat ipsi hilum, and previously positive mediastinal areas. JH doesn't do SCV electively.
