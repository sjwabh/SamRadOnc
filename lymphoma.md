Lymphoma

//Lymphoma:  HL and NHL

EVOLUTION:
1971: Ann Arbor staging system
1989: Cotswolds modifications of the Ann Arbor staging system with introduction of the use of computed tomography (CT)
1999: International Working Group Response Criteria: five clinical response categories based on lesions sizes
2007: International Harmonization Project Criteria: CT evaluation with additional use of relative qualitative evaluation F-18 FDG PET-CT
2009: Deauville five-point scale: qualitative evaluation with graduation of F-18 FDG uptake on PET-CT
2014: Lugano classification
2016: lymphoma response to immunomodulatory therapy criteria (LYRIC)  



Epid: 62,000 in 2000

more T cells than B cells in peripheral circulation,

but more B-cell lymphomas (80%)

B cells more radiosensitive than T cells.



/Staging : for both HD & NHL
(was Ann Arbor, Cotswold modified: revised in 2014 to )
/Lugano staging 
https://radiopaedia.org/articles/lugano-staging-classification-1?lang=us

 as the presence of B symptoms affects only Hodgkin lymphoma treatment, the modifier “B” should be used in patients with this lymphoma type. The associated “X” modifier is no longer applied in Hodgkin or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, instead, the longest diameter of a mass is simply recorded for staging purposes


I - 1 LN group

II - >1 LN group, one side of diaphragm

III - both sides of diaphragm.  IIIs spleen

 1 Above the renal vessels (spleen, splenic, hilar, celiac, portal) (Tx: total nodal irrad (mantle & inverted Y), +/- chemo, OS 85-90%)

 2   Lower abdomen (PA, pelvic, inguinal) (Tx: combo chemo +/- XRT. 75-80% cure)

IV - disseminated extra-LN spread (liver, lung, bone marrow)

E - extralymphatic

S - splenic involvement

/B sx, /B symptoms (only 5% of cases): fever >38/>100.5, drenching night sweats, wt loss 10% over 6 mos

X – bulky (no more X modifier!)

Bulky has been defined as:

 Mediastinal Mass Ratio (MMR) = MaxTumorWidth/MaxThoracicDiameter > 0.33

OR

 Cotswald rule: MaxTumorWidth/(internal thoracic diameter at T5-6 on a PA CXR) > 1/3

OR

 >10cm for non-mediastinal disease

Limited Stage: I-II(<3 LN regions), no B sx, non-bulky.

Advanced Stage: >=II(>3 contiguous LN regions), +B sx, or X (no more X modifier!).






/nodal regions, /LN groups: Waldeyers Ring, Cervical/ SCV/ Pre-Auricular, Infraclavicular, Axillary, Epitrochlear, Mediastinal, Hilar, ParaAortic, Mesenteric, Splenic, Iliac, Inguinal/ Femoral, Popliteal.  (Pelvic LN least commonly involved.)

WORKUP LYMPHOMA:

Hx: B symptoms (now, only for HL!, not for NHL!)

Exam: nodes, liver, spleen

FOE to check Waldeyer's ring

KPS

Labs: CBC, Chem7, LFTs, uric acid

HIV

pregnancy test

fertility cryopreservation

CT neck, chest, abd, pelvis

PET

Bx: Excisional biopsy preferred, CNBx maybe OK

"Remember to include a bone marrow biopsy for ALL non-hodgkin’s lymphoma cases."

BMBx: for all NHL, but only high risk HD (BB4).

BMBx if B or Bulky or Stage III, IV

 (ASTRO 08 says not for IA Bulky)

BMBx indications: B or Bulky, >4 sites

cardiac testing (MUGA) (for adria)

PFTs (for bleo)

encapsulated virus vaccines if splenic RT contemplated

(H flu, pneumo, meningo)

WORKUP (DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HD vs NHL):

HD:

ESR (for early stage HD (AgeB4Sed)

Albumin (for advanced stage HD - HAL SWAM)

NHL:

BMBx

LDH (for NHL IPI-LAKES)

HepB (for Rituxan)

Check CSF w/ /LP in DLBCL if:

CNS

paranasal sinuses

parameningeal

periorbital

paravertebral

breast

testicular

+bone marrow w/ large cell lymphoma

HIV

2 or more extranodal sites

HD tends to be axial (except nodular lymphocyte predominant), mediastinal

NHL  abdominal, peripheral.

//HD /HL /Hodgkin's Lymphoma

M>F, bimodal age dist (3rd and 6th decades).

B-cells.

Reed-Sternberg cells.

REAL / WHO Classification of HD:

/NLP - Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant (5%)

((CD20+ CD45+ CD30- CD15-, L&H popcorn cells)

males, limited to neck, peripheral instead of central,

 BETTER prognosis than Classical, but more late relapses)

10yr EFS 85%

10yr OS >90%

Classical HD (CD20-, CD45-, CD30+ CD15+) (EBV+ in 50%)

 NSHD Nodular sclerosing classical (66% of cases, young women)

 mixed cellularity classical (25% of cases) (EBV)

 lymphocyte-rich classical

 lymphocyte-depleted classical (rare, older pts, worse prognosis)

Rarely do laparotomy for staging anymore. (includes splenectomy, LN sampling (porta hepatis)) Not indicated if chemo to be used anyway.

Pelvic LN least commonly involved.

Advanced stages: IIB with large mediastinal mass (LMM) and extranodal disease, III and IV. Risk Factors were: LMM, extranodal disease, high ESR, and ≥3 LN areas.

/NLP treatment

IA, IIA: ABVDx2+RT or RT alone.  Recent retrospective study in Blood 2011 showed ABVD had better TTP and PFS.  /Savage, Blood 118:4585, 2011.

IFRT 30-36Gy (39.6Gy) alone, no chemo!

IB,IIB,III,IV: Chemo, then IFRT

/HD EARLY STAGE (I,II)

HD RT Dose:

For Stage I, II:

After chemo w/ CR: 30 Gy (Loeffler JCO 97 says 20Gy, Duke says 15Gy!)

After chemo w/ PR: 36 Gy

Definitive RT: 39.6 Gy

No improvement in response above 44Gy.

Ha HD post-chemo RT doses:

If <5cm initially, and CR, then go to 20-25Gy. (20Gy if close to heart)

If 5-10cm initially, and CR, 25-30Gy.

If PR (still PET+), go to 30Gy.

FAVORABLE VS UNFAVORABLE: (YOU SHOULD USE NCCN INSTEAD)

EORTC Criteria for Early Stage HD:

Very Favorable (all of)

<40yo Female w/ non-bulky Stage IA, NLP or NS. ESR<50.

Favorable (Stage I or II, that doesn't meet VF or U criteria)

Unfavorable (any 1 of) (also known as INTERMEDIATE STAGE) AgeB4Sed:

(Not B sx?)

/Tx HD /HD Tx, HD TREATMENT

IA,IIA, FAVORABLE: ABVD x4, IFRT 30Gy.  10yr EFS 85%, 10yr OS 90% (from recalls)

Details:

ABVD x4, only CT(??) after 4,

If CR -> IFRT 30Gy (H9F says you shouldn't omit RT)

If PR -> bx or IFRT 30Gy. If still +PET, consider (other chemo or BMT (HDT/ASCR))

Some people are doing ABVD alone w/o RT. If so, do 2 more chemo after PET CR (up to 6).

ANDREA NG: THERE ARE 6 TRIALS SUPPORTING RT AFTER CHEMO FOR FAVORABLE. (Cite H9F)

I,II UNFAVORABLE: ABVD x6, then IFRT 30-36Gy. (use 36Gy if still PET+)

Details: 10yr EFS 80%, 10yr OS 90%

ABVDx4, re-PET after 4.

If CR, ABVDx2, then IFRT 30Gy. (If non-bulky, NCCN says can go to RT after 4, or skip RT after 6.)

If PR, ABVDx2, then re-PET,

  If CR, IFRT 30Gy. (didn't do 2 more past a CR)

  If PR, IFRT 36Gy (or bx and if +, other 2nd line chemo (ICE, ESHAP))

(Always give IFRT even after CR on PET, per Picardi BULKY Italian trial.

ECOG 2496 LOOK THIS UP. ABVD vs STANFORD V, all got RT 36Gy after bulky. (ASH 2010)

)

(If bulky, can stop after 4 if CR.)

III, IV: 10yr EFS 75%, OS 80%

ABVDx6, then consider IFRT 30-36Gy to initially bulky sites or PR (or I, II sites)

OR

ABVDx8 (nobody's doing 8 anymore), then +/- IFRT 20Gy (SWOG 7808), or 30Gy

Details:

ABVD x4, re-PET after 4,

 If CR, ABVDx2, stop OR consider IFRT 30Gy to bulky sites

 If PR, ABVDx2, then re-PET,

    if CR, consider IFRT 30Gy to bulky sites, OR ABVDx2 (total 8) and no IFRT

    if PR, IFRT 36Gy or (other chemo or BMT)

or per EORTC 20884: MOPP-ABV x6-8, and IFRT 30Gy only if PR.

I say:

if PET-, IFRT 30Gy

if PET+ or bulky, IFRT 36Gy

118pts, Retrospective.

RT improved DFS but not OS.

Mediastinal RT improved OS.

Consolidative RT after CR may benefit patients with initial disease above the diaphragm, whereas below-the-diaphragm disease seems to be well managed by chemotherapy alone.

EORTC-GELA H8 (EORTC 20931) (H8F & H8U)

Ferme, NEJM 2007, "NCT00379041" "november 8, 2007"

For Stage I,II, supradiaphragm HD. (36-40Gy)

For H8F,

 MOPP-ABV x3 + IFRT vs. STNI alone, better EFS 98% v 74%

For H8U,

 MOPP-ABV x6 + IFRT (lotta chemo little RT)

 MOPP-ABV x4 + STNI (little chemo lotta RT)

 MOPP-ABV x4 + IFRT (little chemo little RT)

 (These all turned out the same (EFS 84-87%), so recommend just do little chemo, little RT.)

LEARN THIS ONE FOR THE ORALS:  THIS IS WHY WE DON'T OMIT RT FOR VF OR F.

EORTC-GELA /H9 (/H9F & H9U) (EORTC 20982)

For Early Stage VF/F, Don't omit RT, only need 20Gy.

Prelim Results "7th International Symposium on Hodgkin Lymphoma, Cologne, Germany, November 3-7 2007”

N=1591

For VF or F, EBVP x6, then if CR, randomized to:

 6 EBVP + No RT

 6 EBVP + IFRT 20Gy

 6 EBVP + IFRT 36Gy

What did they do if less than CR???

The NoRT arm did much worse and closed early dt excess relapses w/ this "mild" chemotherapy.

RT improved 5yr FFS 85-89% v 69%.

But no diff between 20Gy and 36Gy (85-89%).

OS 98-100%

Critique: inferior chemo

For /H9U, randomized to

 6 ABVD + IFRT 30Gy

 4 ABVD + IFRT 30Gy

 4 BEACOPP + IFRT 30Gy

No diff in 5yr TFFS (treatment-failure free survival) (85-91%).

OS 93-94%

Conclusions: BEACOPP more toxic, and only need 4 cycles ABVD.

EORTC /H10F, H10U

http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/EORTC-20051#StudyIdInfo_CDR0000531125

For supradiaphragm I-II

For H10F,

 ABVDx3, INRT 30Gy

 vs

 ABVDx2, PET

 If PET-, ABVDx2 (ARM closed early due to poor results)

 If PET+, esc BEACOPP x2, then INRT

For H10U,

 ABVDx4, INRT 30Gy

 vs

 ABVDx2, PET

 If PET-, ABVDx4 (ARM closed early due to poor results)

 If PET+, BEACOPP x2, then INRT

THIS IS WHY WE STILL ALWAYS RECOMMEND RT EVEN AFTER CR.

GHSG /HD10 (20 v 30, 2 v 4 cycles), (Engert A, N Engl J Med 2010 Aug 12; 363:640-652)

http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1000067

For Early Stage (FAVORABLE)

ABVD x2 vs ABVD x4

IFRT 20Gy vs IFRT 30Gy

No diff.

So 20Gy is enough, 2 cycles ABVD are enough.

Critique: only have 4 yr FU so far, still need longer FU.

Non-inferiority. ABVD x4 = ABVD x2 (FFTF5 93% v 91%; p=0.39; also p=ns: OS5, PFS5). IFRT 30 Gy = 20 Gy (FFTF5 93.4% v 92.9%)

Toxicity = G3/4 acute toxicity: ABVD x4 > ABVD x2 (≥1 event: 51.7% v 33.2%); 30 Gy > 20 Gy (8.7% v 2.9%; p<0.001)

Caveat = "Although the 5-year estimate for the group difference between the most intensive treatment and the least intensive treatment in this study was only 1.6 percentage points, a potential difference of 6.3 percentage points in favor of the more intensive treatment cannot be excluded."

NCCN recommends only doing 2c if only 2 sites and no extralymphatic.

GHSG /HD11 - for Intermediate Stage (UNFAVORABLE)

Klimm, Blood 2005 ;106:816. (Interim anlysis)

Borchman, ASH 2009, "after 4xABVD, a relevant inferiority of 20Gy cannot be excluded"

ABVD x4 vs BEACOPP x4

IFRT 20Gy vs IFRT 30Gy

Results: BEACOPP is more effective than ABVD if followed by 20Gy IF-RT (5y-FFTF difference 5.7%, 95%-CI [0.1%; 11.3%]). This effect does not exist in combination with 30Gy IF-RT (5y-FFTF difference 1.6% [-3.6%; 6.9%]). Similar results are observed for the RT-question: After 4 cycles of Bbas, 20Gy is not inferior to 30Gy (5y-FFTF difference -0.1%, 95%-CI [-5.1%; 4.9%]), whereas after 4xABVD, a relevant inferiority of 20Gy cannot be excluded (-4.0% [-9.5%; 1.4%]).

SO... if you give ABVDx4, maybe you still need 30Gy.

Standard for EARLY STAGE UNFAVORABLE is still ABVD x4 + IFRT 30Gy.

HD10, HD11:  lower dose 20Gy works well for early stage but maybe not enough for intermediate stage.

Since HD is very radiosensitive, if equivocal results after chemo or still PET+, go ahead and do RT, but for NHL (DLCL), should do bx first, if +, consider BMT.

Compared MOPP-ABV x6-8 cycles +/-  IFRT for stage III/IV HD pts.

Update for the PR subset of EORTC 20884 who all got IFRT (Aleman, Red 07, "doi:10.1016/j.ijrobp.2006.08.041"):

8yr EFS 76%, OS 84% (similar to both CR groups!)

Conclusions: After MOPP-ABV x 6-8 cycles,

 If CR -> No RT

 If PR -> IFRT 30Gy

Critiques: MOPP-ABV is very toxic and not used in North America.  Didn't have many pts w/ bulky dz.  So may still need RT after CR if you didn't use MOPP-ABV or if you had bulky dz.

/HD SMN /SMN /Secondary malignancies:

Second malignancies are the most serious late complication following successful treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma.

Our study revealed that the actuarial risk of developing a second malignancy was equivalent between patients that received radiation vs. those that did not receive radiation. There was a higher number of secondary leukemias in the group that did not receive radiation therapy, which may be due to this group having received more cycles of chemotherapy.

[Despite] a significant decrease in the utilization of radiation therapy over the past 20 years, it was interesting to note that despite these changes there was no significant difference in the actuarial rate of second malignancies between those patients treated in an earlier treatment era from 1988–1997 and from 1998–2007.

/FORT  4 Gy versus 24 Gy radiotherapy for patients with indolent lymphoma (FORT): a randomised phase 3 non-inferiority trial.

Lancet Oncol. 2014 Apr;15(4):457-63. doi: 10.1016/S1470-2045(14)70036-1. Epub 2014 Feb 24. PMID:24572077

BACKGROUND:

Follicular lymphoma has been shown to be highly radiosensitive with responses to doses as low as 4 Gy in two fractions. This trial was designed to explore the dose response for follicular lymphoma comparing 4 Gy in two fractions with 24 Gy in 12 fractions

METHODS:

FORT is a prospective randomised, unblinded, phase 3 non-inferiority study comparing radiotherapy given as 4 Gy in two fractions with a standard dose of 24 Gy in 12 fractions. Entry criteria included all patients aged over 18 years, having local radiotherapy for radical or palliative local control, with follicular lymphoma or marginal zone lymphoma, who had received no previous treatment for at least 1 month before. The primary outcome was time to local progression analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. Randomisation was centralised through the Cancer Research UK and University College London Cancer Trials Centre. Radiotherapy target sites were randomised (1:1) with minimisation stratified by histology (follicular lymphoma vs marginal zone lymphoma), treatment intent (palliative or curative) and centre. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00310167.

FINDINGS:

299 sites were randomly assigned to 24 Gy and 315 sites to 4 Gy between April 7, 2006, and June 8, 2011, at 43 centres in the UK. After a median follow-up of 26 months (range 0·39-75·4), 91 local progressions had been recorded (21 in the 24 Gy group and 70 in the 4 Gy group). Time to local progression with 4 Gy was not non-inferior to 24 Gy (hazard ratio 3·42, 95% CI 2·09-5·55, p<0·0001). Eight (3%) of 282 patients in the 24 Gy group and four (1%) of 300 in the 4 Gy group had acute grade 3-4 toxic effects. Four (1%) patients in the 24 Gy group and four (1%) patients in the 4 Gy group had late toxic effects. Mucositis was the most common event in the 24 Gy group (two patients with acute mucositis and two with late mucositis; all grade 3) and was not reported in the 4 Gy group. The most common acute effect was pain at the site of irradiation (two patients in the 4 Gy group, one patient in the 24 Gy group; all grade 3), and the most common late effect was fatigue (two patients in the 4 Gy group, one patient in the 24 Gy group; all grade 3).

INTERPRETATION:

24 Gy in 12 fractions is the more effective radiation schedule for indolent lymphoma and should be regarded as the standard of care. However, 4 Gy remains a useful alternative for palliative treatment.

In this work, we have studied the response rates and duration of response after low-dose (4 Gy) involved field radiotherapy (LD-IF-RT) in relapsed or chemotherapy refractory indolent and aggressive lymphoma patients. 71 patients (177 symptomatic sites) received LD-IF-RT consisting of 39 males and 32 females with a median age of 69 years (range 43-93). Patients included were those with small lymphocytic lymphoma/chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (n=23), marginal zone lymphoma, nodal type (n=18), mantle cell lymphoma (n=17), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (n=13). Bulky disease (5 cm) was present in 73% of all patients. A median of two prior chemotherapy regimens (range 0-10) preceded LD-IF-RT. Median time since diagnosis was 31 months (range 1-216 months). Time to (local) progression was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Differences in response rates were compared using the chi2-test. The results showed that overall response rate was 87%; complete remission (CR) was reached in 34 patients (48%) and a partial remission (PR) in 28 patients (39%). Stable disease (SD) was maintained in nine patients (13%). The median time to progression (TP) was 12 months and the median time to local progression (TLP) was 22 months. The 34 CR patients showed a median TP of 16 months and a median TLP of 23 months. None of the factors studied (age, sex, lymphoma subtype, radiotherapy regimen, number of prior regimens or time since diagnosis, number of positive sites or largest lymphoma diameter) were found to relate to response. At time of death 70% of patients were without in-field progression after LD-IF-RT. It appears that LD-IF-RT is a valuable asset in the management of relapsed disease in both indolent and aggressive lymphoma and should be considered to palliate symptoms in patients with recurrent and/or chemotherapy refractory disease

NCCN-IPI — The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)-IPI incorporates more detailed information about the clinical variables used in the original IPI (ie, age, LDH, ECOG performance status, stage, and extranodal disease). Specifically, age and LDH are considered as continuous rather than dichotomous variables, and the location of extranodal disease is used rather than the number of extranodal sites. These changes make the NCCN-IPI more cumbersome than the original IPI to apply at the bedside. For now, the original IPI remains our preferred prognostic index for patients with DLBCL.

Clinical variables and outcomes of 1650 patients with de novo DLBCL treated at seven NCCN cancer centers from 2000 to 2010 were used to create the NCCN-IPI, which awards points for each of the following variables [16]:

●Age 41 to 60 years – 1 point

●Age >60 to 75 years – 2 points

●Age >75 years – 3 points

●LDH ratio >1 to 3 – 1 point

●LDH ratio >3 – 2 points

●ECOG PS ≥2 – 1 point

●Ann Arbor stage III to IV – 1 point

●Extranodal disease involving the bone marrow, central nervous system, liver/gastrointestinal tract, or lung – 1 point

The LDH variable is the ratio of the patient's LDH level to the upper limit of normal at the institution. The NCCN-IPI is the sum of these points. When applied to a separate cohort of 1138 patients in a registry from the British Columbia Cancer Agency treated with R-CHOP with curative intent since 2001, the NCCN-IPI was able to stratify patients into four risk groups with significantly different OS and PFS at five years:

●Low risk – 0 to 1 points (12 percent); OS 96 percent; PFS 94 percent

●Low-intermediate risk – 2 to 3 points (37 percent); OS 77 percent; PFS 72 percent

●High-intermediate risk – 4 to 5 points (37 percent); OS 56 percent; PFS 54 percent

●High risk – ≥6 points (14 percent); OS 38 percent; PFS 35 percent

5-yr OS > 95%

Primary cutaneous FC lymphomas may be treated with radiotherapy or combination chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for localised tumours whereas multiple tumours on the skin of different parts of the body (multifocal) may respond better to combination chemotherapy. Patients with primary cutaneous FC lymphomas have a good overall survival rate. Five-year survival is reported to be more than 95%.

Tx: 20-45Gy

  PCLCL - primary cutaneous large b cell lymphoma, leg type

    From UpToDate:

PCLBCL, leg type is widely reported to have a more aggressive clinical course than other categories of PCBCL. In contrast to PCFCL and PCMZL, which have estimated five-year survival rates of over 95 percent [1,9,28], PCLBCL, leg type has an estimated five-year survival rate of between 41 and 66 percent, with higher rates reported since the more routine incorporation of rituximab [7,9,10,29-31]. While a watch and wait approach or treatment with localized therapy is often appropriate for other types of primary cutaneous B cell lymphoma, patients with PCLBCL, leg type require a more aggressive approach with combination chemotherapy.

From http://www.dermnetnz.org/dermal-infiltrative/b-cell-lymphoma.html :

Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type

These cutaneous B-cell lymphomas occur mainly in elderly females and present as erythematous red or bluish-red nodules or tumours usually on one or both lower legs. These tumours are more aggressive than large B-cell lymphomas of the head and neck, often disseminate to extracutaneous sites and have a more unfavourable prognosis.

Histologically these lymphomas show a diffuse monotonous population of centroblasts and immunoblasts. This picture may be seen in lesions not arising on the leg, and these can be classified into this group.

Only some localised small tumours may be treated using radiotherapy. Anthracycline-based chemotherapy is used for most skin tumours or when tumours have spread to other parts of the body. Some cases have shown response to the anti-CD20 antibody rituximab. Death usually occurs with disseminated disease.

/LyP is characterized by a chronic course, lasting years or decades. Grouped or disseminated papules and nodules develop and spontaneously regress over 3-8 weeks. Early lesions appear as small red papules, which evolve to larger papules or nodules that may develop central hemorrhage, necrosis, and crusting and subsequently disappear in three to eight weeks. No B symptoms.

 Patients with LyP have an excellent prognosis, although they are at increased risk of developing a second cutaneous or nodal lymphoma, such as mycosis fungoides, pcALCL, or Hodgkin lymphoma.

There are six major histologic types of LyP lesions: Types A,B,C,D,E,LyP w/ 6p23.5 rearrangement.

* Systemic B symptoms are defined as temperature >38°C (>100.4°F), unexplained weight loss of >10 percent of body weight over the past six months, and/or the presence of drenching night sweats.

• Regional lymph node involvement was defined as the invasion of lymph nodes corresponding to N1, N2, or N3 of the primary lesion in the American Joint Committee on Cancer tumor (T), nodes (N), metastasis (M) staging system. An example of regional lymph node involvement is the involvement of cervical nodes for patients with NK/T cell lymphoma of the upper aerodigestive tract.

/MZL /Marginal Zone Lymphomas, t(11;18). a group of related B-cell neoplasms that involve the lymphoid tissues in the marginal zone,the patchy area outside the follicular mantle zone.  http://www.histol.chuvashia.com/atlas-en/lymphoid-en.htm

The three diseases in this category that are recognized in the REAL/WHO classification systems include:

●Extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type (MALT-type lymphoma, MALT lymphoma) [4].   Extranodal MZL === MALT === BALT === SALT

●Nodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma

●Splenic marginal zone B cell lymphoma (± villous lymphocytes)

There is no clinical overlap of extranodal MZL (MALT lymphoma) and nodal MZL with splenic MZL, despite the fact that splenic MZL may have a marginal zone pattern; these diseases appear to be completely unrelated. 

EXTRANODAL (MALT) MZL — Extranodal marginal zone B cell lymphoma, also called low grade B cell lymphoma of mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT), is an extranodal lymphoma that arises in a number of epithelial tissues, including the stomach, salivary gland, lung, small bowel, thyroid, and elsewhere. It was originally often referred to as a "pseudo-lymphoma" because of its tendency to remain localized to the tissue of origin for long periods of time, but it is now appreciated that it is a clonal B cell neoplasm that frequently recurs locally and has potential for systematic spread and transformation to a high-grade B cell lymphoma. Extranodal MZL of the lung is sometimes referred to as bronchial-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT) lymphoma (image 1), while extranodal MZL of the skin may be referred to as skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT) lymphoma.

Many patients with MALT have a history of autoimmune disease (eg, Sjögren's syndrome, relapsing polychondritis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis) with or without coexisting infections .

After stomach, next most common sites of extranodal MZL are small intestine, salivary gland, lung, head and neck, ocular adnexa, skin, thyroid, and breast.

  1/3 of pts have advanced stage at presentation.

/Tx: 

Locoregional radiation therapy is the main treatment option for limited stage disease. Surgery is typically used for diagnostic purposes only but may play a role in the treatment of tumors in areas not conducive to radiation therapy (eg, lung). The addition of adjuvant chemotherapy or antibiotic therapy has not demonstrated improved disease-free or overall survival rates. There are occasional patients with stage I disease who are not ideal candidates for radiation therapy and may be initially observed closely.

Locoregional radiotherapy (RT) with 25 to 30 Gy is the principal therapy for most cases of limited stage extranodal MALT. This lymphoma is very sensitive to radiation and doses should not exceed 30 Gy. Because of the risk of the ocular structures to radiation, doses of 25 to 30 Gy are used for ocular MALT with excellent results [4]. With recurrent disease or advanced disease, lower doses may suffice and doses as low as 400 cGy given in two fractions can be effective for palliation.

With this approach, rates of complete response and local control are in excess of 90 percent.

Surgery can be used as initial therapy if not amenable to RT (but where in the body would that be??), or if unclear preoperatively that it was pure MZL.  However, if an initial surgical specimen demonstrates positive margins, adjuvant involved field RT is administered to avoid local recurrence.

No clear role for adjuv chemo in E-MZL.  Abx also not proven for non-gastric MALT.

San Antonio:

Lung Blocks: Use 2 HVL for half of the fractions, limits dose to 62.5%. 19cGy/min.

Add lung blocks (1 HVL, 1cm margin) at 3rd fx, and

add 9e- chest wall boost (for APPA only) (R & L, AP & PA) to compensate (no CW boost for laterals).

w/ pre-TBI prophy cranial boost of 200 x 5,

w/ concurrent testicular boost of 200 x 2-3,

Need Low Dose Rate to reduce rate of interstitial pneumonitis, and causes less damage to bone marrow stromal support cells.

/Dose Rate, /DoseRate: Usually about 20cGy/min for APPA.

Slow dose rate would be ~6-15cGy/min.

< 15 (10-15) cGy/min for APPA

Minimum dose 10Gy for myeloma.

Abstract

PURPOSE: This reviews the experience at the University of Arizona in an effort to define the minimum effective radiation dose for durable pain relief in the majority of patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma.

METHODS AND MATERIALS: The records of 101 patients with multiple myeloma irradiated for palliation at the University of Arizona between 1975 and 1990 were reviewed. Three hundred sixteen sites were treated. Ten sites were asymptomatic, including six hemibody fields with advanced disease unresponsive to chemotherapy and four local fields with impending pathological fractures. Three hundred six evaluable symptomatic sites remained. The most common symptom was bone pain. Other symptoms included neurological impairment and a palpable mass.

RESULTS: Total tumor dose ranged from 3.0 to 60 Gy, with a mean of 25 Gy. Symptom relief was obtained in 297 of 306 evaluable symptomatic sites (97%). Complete relief of symptoms was obtained in 26% and partial relief in 71%. Symptom relief was obtained in 92% of sites receiving a total dose less than 10 Gy (n = 13) and 98% of sites receiving 10 Gy or more (n = 293). No dose-response could be demonstrated. The likelihood of symptom relief was not influenced by the location of the lesion or the use of concurrent chemotherapy. Of the 297 responding sites, 6% (n = 19) relapsed after a median symptom-free interval of 16 months. Neither the probability of relapse nor the time to relapse was related to the radiation dose. Retreatment of relapsing sites provided effective palliation in all cases.

CONCLUSION: Radiation therapy is effective in palliating local symptoms in multiple myeloma. A total dose of 10 Gy should provide durable symptom relief in the majority of patients.

/Deauville

The Deauville 5-point scoring system is an internationally accepted and utilized five-point scoring system for the Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity of a Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tumor mass as seen on FDG Positron emission tomography:[1]

Score 1: No uptake above the background

Score 2: Uptake ≤ mediastinum

Score 3: Uptake > mediastinum but ≤ liver

Score 4: Uptake moderately increased compared to the liver at any site

Score 5: Uptake markedly increased compared to the liver at any site

Score X: New areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma

Scores of 1 and 2 are considered to be negative and 4 and 5 are considered to be positive. "Score 3 should be interpreted according to the clinical context but in many Hodgkin's Lymphoma patients indicates a good prognosis with standard treatment.
