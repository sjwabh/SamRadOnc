/Heart /Cardiac 
http://clincancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/14/1/14.full

The most frequently diagnosed cardiac problems during radiotherapy are acute pericarditis, pericardial effusion, and arrhythmias. Acute radiation damage to pericardial and intimal coronary endocytes eventually leads to myocyte ischemia and fibrosis (85). Constrictive pericarditis is a serious long-term complication that may require pericardectomy. It is more frequently seen in patients who receive mediastinal radiation for Hodgkin's lymphoma than those who receive adjuvant tangential breast irradiation. The incidence of constrictive pericarditis with modern techniques is as yet unknown as the median presentation is 13 years postradiation (86). Radiotherapy damage to coronary endocytes triggers inflammation and eventually leads to atherosclerosis (87). The risk of cardiac disease seems to increase for decades after radiation therapy and has been fully reviewed elsewhere (88).

Although an initial metaanalysis of adjuvant breast cancer radiation trials showed that improved disease-free survival was counteracted by excess cardiac mortality (89), a recent metaanalysis that included trials with modern radiation techniques found that increased overall survival was associated with radiotherapy (90). Most cardiac disease has been observed in patients receiving radiation to left chest wall after a left-side mastectomy, but current radiotherapy techniques deliver less radiation to the heart than those of 30 years ago even to patients with left-side tumors (91). Earlier epidemiologic cohort studies observed a higher risk of cardiac death (92) among patients with left-side breast cancer than those with right-side breast cancer, and this risk increased with time since treatment (Table 3 ). However, a Surveillance Epidemiology End Results analysis (93) of patients who received left-side versus right-side irradiation between 1986 and 1993 did not find significant differences in hospitalization for cardiac disease or heart failure. Although these studies were large and adequately powered, right-side breast irradiation does expose the heart to some radiation, especially if internal mammary lymph nodes are also irradiated. Consequently, a more appropriate control group would have been nonirradiated patients. A recent Dutch study (94) compared 4,414 10-year survivors of breast cancer, treated between 1970 and 1986, to the Dutch female population. The authors divided the group into patients treated before and after 1980 when breast-conserving therapy was introduced. Breast irradiation alone did not increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Internal left or right mammary chain radiation in the period 1970 to 1979 increased the risk of myocardial infarction and CHF. In the cohort who received internal mammary chain radiation after 1979, the risk of CHF and valvular dysfunction remained elevated but not that of myocardial infarction. Left but not right chest wall irradiation increased the risk of myocardial infarction for the entire treatment period 1979 to 1986. Interestingly patients treated after 1979 who also received adjuvant CMF chemotherapy had an increased risk of CHF compared with those who received radiation alone. Smoking and radiation seemed to have a synergistic effect on increasing the risk of myocardial infarction (94). Patients treated with tangential field irradiation post–left-sided breast conserving surgery had more coronary artery stenosis, especially in the left anterior descending artery than patients with right-sided breast cancer (95). Patients treated with modern techniques that irradiate <5% of heart volume may still develop subtle defects in cardiac perfusion, which could result from irradiation of the left-anterior descending coronary artery causing arteritis (96), but this report was not confirmed in another study (97). Although new techniques, including intensity-modulated radiotherapy (98) combined with free breathing gating (99) and helical tomotherapy (100), may further reduce radiation-induced cardiac toxicities (101), the most important factors in limiting cardiac radiation are associated with the techniques used and the skill of the radiation oncologist.

/plexopathy, brachial

For SBRT of apical lung tumors, the risk of brachial plexopathy be reduced by keeping the maximum radiation dose to a brachial plexus below 26 Gy in 3 or 4 fractions.

http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/316497-overview#a5

Risk factors:  Treatment technique, radiation volume,and concomitant use of chemotherapy are associated with development of radiation injury to the brachial plexus. Surgical lymph node dissection; and underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and vascular disease all demonstrate significant association with the development of radiation injury to the brachial plexus. The current incidence is 1-2% in patients receiving a typical dose of less than 55 Gy. Most commonly, the plexopathy develops months to years after radiation therapy and demonstrates a relatively stable course over months to years with a gradual worsening of paresthesias and pain. One third of patients deteriorate rapidly and exhibit significant weakness, lymphedema, and pain. Rarely, the disorder presents as a mild and relatively reversible set of symptoms. The average interval range reported is 7.5 months to 6 years; however, symptoms may develop decades after treatment. Sensory symptoms, such as numbness, paresthesia, and dysesthesia, along with swelling and weakness of the arm, are the predominant presenting symptoms. These neurologic symptoms can be progressive and may lead to a weak and edematous arm. Most radiation plexopathies are painless, but when present, pain symptoms usually are limited to the shoulder and proximal arm. Such pain usually is rated as mild to moderate in intensity. Significant pain complaints are more commonly associated with recurrent tumor than with radiation plexopathy. The lymphatic-vascular system may reveal prominent lymphedema of the involved extremity without cyanotic or dusky features. 

Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the involved brachial plexus may reveal a diffuse infiltration of the tissue planes.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) often reveals low signal intensity on T2-weighted images; minimal changes are found with gadolinium.[13, 18, 19]

All of these characteristics are in contrast to neoplastic processes, which would be identified by the presence of a focal mass.

Treatment:

Physical Therapy: Therapeutic modalities should focus on pain reduction, strengthening, preservation of range of motion, and limiting lymphedema.

Hyperbaric O2 doesn't help.

Radiation-induced /brachial plexopathy (RBP) is another relevant topic since it can be confused with Neoplastic Brachial Plexopathy (NBP). As treatment may be different for the two conditions, differentiation between RBP and NBP is important, although it may be difficult. As many as 73% of patients who have undergone radiotherapy at more than 60 Gy develop plexopathy. Overall incidence of brachial plexopathy is approximately 1.8% of treated patients; however, several factors play a role in development of the condition, including dose (incidence is higher with doses more than 50 Gy), volume irradiated, and treatment technique, as well as whether chemotherapy is administered concurrently. Emami reports 5% incidence of NBP at 5 years when the patient has been treated at doses of 60 Gy to the entire plexus; however, up to one third of patients with RBP find that the deterioration may stop after several years.

Some historical findings suggestive of NBP include the following:

Onset of limb pain less than 6 months following radiation

Rapid progression

Horner syndrome (in two thirds of patients with Pancoast syndrome)

Severe pain predominant

Other metastases

Focal mass or neoplasm on biopsy

The most reliable feature of NBP (in 80% of patients) is early severe unrelenting pain. Fewer than 20% of RBP patients present with pain, and approximately 33% have minimal or no pain throughout the course of the disease. Two thirds of patients with RBP show severe neurologic deficit progression over several years, while in one third of patients, progression spontaneously ceases after 1-3 years.[5] More common findings in RBP include the following:

Slowly progressive course, duration greater than 4 years

Predominant paresthesias

Median sensory amplitude decreased early

Involvement of the upper trunk or C5-C6 portions of the plexus

Conduction block on supraclavicular stimulation

Myokymia on needle examination

Case report of SLE pt on HCQ receiving breast RT who developed severe rash, even outside of port fields, mostly in sun exposed areas:
Another possible explanation for her extensive rash is ultraviolet sensitivity, which is a well-described adverse effect of hydroxychloroquine.17 As the rash appeared primarily in a sun-exposed area, there may have been a synergistic effect of therapeutic radiation, which often increases the probability of sunburns, and hydroxychloroquine-induced ultraviolet sensitivity, causing the severe dermatitis. Usually patients with SLE present with chronic radiation dermatitis consequences; however, hydroxychloroquine could have accelerated the timing of the dermatitis’ appearance and spread of a hydroxychloroquine-induced erythema multiforme reaction

https://www.cancerjournal.net/preprintarticle.asp?id=343913
 This report describes the case of a 30-year-old young female who had enhanced skin reactions with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) treatment during breast RT. HCQ should be used with caution in patients undergoing RT due to its potential radiosensitizer effect.
In published works, we can only find 3 case reports about excessive interaction with RT and HCQ. The first case in seventies was a 54-year-old arthritic woman who were 2 years on chloroquine therapy. She was treated with RT because of a recurrent breast tumor on left chest wall. After completion of RT, a brisk erythema without desquamation was noted. However, it was progressed to a chest wall necrosis a few months later.[3] The other case was a 12-year-old girl with brainstem glioma. She had an empirical treatment of malaria during the 5th week of RT and developed moist desquamation on the scalp after the 3rd day of chloroquine treatment. After 1 week break, a significant healing was observed and RT completed safely.[4] The same group reported a 57-year-old female who had breast RT for locally advanced breast carcinoma. The day after completion of whole breast RT, she was treated with chloroquine due to fever with rigors. On the 3rd day of chloroquine treatment, she had a striking moist desquamation involving inframammary fold.[5]              LOOK THESE UP.

Radiation therapy in people with an ATM mutation 
Based on research in people who have a mutation in both copies of their ATM gene (see our Other Considerations section), there have been some questions raised about the safety of radiation therapy to treat cancer in people with a single ATM mutation. According to experts, cancer patients with a single ATM mutation can undergo radiation therapy to treat their cancer as recommended by their oncologist.

ESOPHAGUS

Treat SCV?

Yes, still treat SCV, all to 50.4.  APPA (this has least lung) to 39.6, then obliques (supplement 1 side w/ e's (cuz blocking cord).  What about Lung V20?  I don't think he looks at this.

Dose escalate for cervical esophagus? He doesn't, but knows this is controversial.

Dose for definitive esophagus? R Komaki likes higher doses, but Minsky doesn't.

Is upfront esophagectomy still acceptable standard of care?

Still yes, essentially same survival Surg vs CRT.    There are 6  RCTs, 2 of which are positive (but Tepper study is small) suggesting that PreOp CRT probably improves OS by 5-10%.

PostOp don't try to cover the cervical anastomosis, field is too big.

What if TE fistula? stent? lower dose?

Minsky says some say don't treat them, high mortality. Historically this was a contraindication to chemoRT (most of these were excluded in the RCTs), but some treat them.  Minsky does treat these.

For SCC, if Post Op mid thoracic T3N1, esophagectomy alone.  (per NCCN)  But if AdenoCA, then chemoRT.

GASTRIC

Unresectable: Start w/ chemo only, then re-stage (laparoscopy to look for omental dz), CRT to 50.4.

If preop ECF given, do you give postop chemoRT? No, only if M+.  Don't make up new regimens.

What about doing preop chemoRT?  Yes, Minsky recommends this, esp for T3 or N+, if surgeon willing, extrapolating from other sites.

PANCREATIC

Resectable:  "There were 2 poor RCTs: GITSG (positive trial, but small study), ESPAC (negative trial but poor quality), but I look at the large body of single institution non-RCT data that show benefit to CRT."

(He seems to de-emphasize the RTOG 9704 trial.)

Unresectable: chemo first, then restage (laparoscopy (Crane says no)), then chemoRT?  2% will be cured(!).

Remember gem is toxic w/ RT, don't give w/ RT.

RECTAL

For PreOp T4 w/ sacral involvement, boost to 54 instead of 50?  NO, he never goes above 50.4 for anything pre-op.  

M may give intra op, but don't say this if you don't have it at your institution.

Include sacrum in Boost field? YES.

uT3N0 @ 10cm?

Minsky says yes to preop CRT, because per GRCT, 20% will be pN+, and if you don't, they will need post op CRT. :(

The flip side is that we may be overtreating 20% that turn out to be pT1-2N0.

Guillem, JCO 2008

Unlike Colon, Rectal still has late failures after 5yrs, so still need 7yr follow-up data.

Proctitis: steroids for simple cases.  For more complex, "I'd work closely w/ a gastroenterologist to manage..."

What's the standard postOp Chemo after PreOp CRT & LAR-TME?  

"5FU-based x 4 cycles (4 months)"  Minsky says standard adjuv chemo is now FOLFOX.

Adjuv chemo is the most important part!  There is a 10-15% survival benefit w/ adjuvant 5FU-based chemo.  

If you have to do post-op CRT:

PostOp Rectal sequencing: chemo first, then CRT, chemo.  

Do you treat PostOp pT2N1 and pT3N0?

If post op pT3N0 after TME, benefit of RT is small amount LC, so can skip RT if >12 nodes sampled, only 2-3% LC benefit, not worth toxicities, unless <12 nodes examined. (Despite Gunderson pooled analysis.)

If post op pT2N1 after TME, Minsky still treats w/ RT (he gives postop RT for any N+), but he knows he's in minority.  He goes by Dutch TME trial that showed that even after TME, the subset w/ N+ had high LF 21%.

T1-2N0 w/ WLE, had late >5yr recurrences.  Don't do WLE except for T1's. Long term data show up to 10% LR now (U Minnesota data (look this up)).

If you did happen to do a WLE and found a T2Nx, first choice is re-excision w/ TME (and only add RT if N+), second choice is post op CRT.

Problem w/ 5x5 is can't give chemo, and chemo is what improves survival.

Would a resected colon cancer with its anastomosis below the peritoneal reflection be treated like a rectal

ca?

If low sigmoid CA (T4) stuck to something, treat like rectum.

Only diff between rectal and colon CA is  harder to get good surgical margins in the pelvis.

Distance from AV

Minsky uses 12cm (peritoneal reflection) w/ straight scope as his cutoff for giving RT.

Guillem found no diff in ypN+ rate for prox vs distal tumors.

ANAL

Impotence rate for pelvic chemoRT for rectal, anal, APR?

Dose for positive inguinal nodes?

How to treat anal margin tumors? WLE vs RT alone: nodes?

 If >5cm away from AV, then WLE.

 IF < 5cm, then chemoRT.  M never does perineal e- boost.  M always treats full fields, except maybe start at bottom of SI joint.

How to treat anal adenoCA (15%)?  Always salvage APR? Yes.

Always go by histology: For SCC always treat like Anal. For adeno, treat like rectal w/ surgery.

FU: exam q6wks w/ no bx, just keep following as long as getting smaller,  after CR then q3mo. If doesn't get smaller, then bx, then APR.

Distant spread for anal is rare.

Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for medically inoperable lung metastases-A pooled analysis of the German working group "stereotactic radiotherapy".

Rieber

DOI: 10.1016/j.lungcan.2016.04.012

OBJECTIVES:

The current literature on stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for oligometastatic disease is characterized by small patient cohorts with heterogeneous primary tumors, metastases location and dose regimes. Hence, this study established a multi-institutional database of 700 patients treated with SBRT for pulmonary metastases to identify prognostic factors influencing survival and local control.

MATERIALS AND METHODS:

All German radiotherapy departments were contacted and invited to participate in this analysis. A total number of 700 patients with medically inoperable lung metastases treated with SBRT in 20 centers between 1997 and 2014 were included in a database. Primary and metastatic tumor characteristics, treatment characteristics and follow-up data including survival, local control, distant metastases, and toxicity were evaluated. Lung metastases were treated with median PTV-encompassing single doses of 12.5Gy (range 3.0-33.0Gy) in a median number of 3 fractions (range 1-13).

RESULTS:

After a median follow-up time of 14.3 months, 2-year local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) were 81.2% and 54.4%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, OS was most significantly influenced by pretreatment performance status, maximum metastasis diameter, primary tumor histology, time interval between primary tumor diagnosis and SBRT treatment and number of metastases. For LC, independent prognostic factors were pretreatment performance status, biological effective dose (BED) at PTV isocenter (BEDISO) and single fraction (PTV-encompassing) dose in multivariate analysis. Radiation-induced pneumonitis grade 2 or higher was observed in 6.5% of patients. The only factor significantly influencing toxicity was BEDISO (p=0.006).

CONCLUSION:

SBRT for medically inoperable patients with pulmonary metastases achieved excellent local control and promising overall survival. Important prognostic factors were identified for selecting patients who might benefit most from this therapy approach.

OBJECTIVES:

To report overall survival and local control for patients identified in the RSSearch® Patient Registry with metastatic cancer to the lung treated with SBRT.

METHODS:

Seven hundred two patients were identified with lung metastases in the RSSearch® Registry. Of these patients, 577 patients had SBRT dose and fractionation information available. Patients were excluded if they received prior surgery, radiation, or radiofrequency ablation to the SBRT treated area. Between April 2004-July 2015, 447 patients treated with SBRT at 30 academic and community-based centers were evaluable for overall survival (OS). Three hundred four patients with 327 lesions were evaluable for local control (LC). All doses were converted to Monte Carlo equivalents and subsequent BED Gy10 for dose response analysis.

RESULTS:

Median age was 69 years (range, 18-93 years). Median Karnofsky performance status (KPS) was 90 (range 25/75% 80-100). 49.2% of patients had prior systemic therapy. Median metastasis volume was 10.58 cc (range 25/75% 3.7-25.54 cc). Site of primary tumor included colorectal (25.7%), lung (16.6%), head and neck (11.4%), breast (9.2%), kidney (8.1%), skin (6.5%) and other (22.1%). Median dose was 50 Gy (range 25/75% 48-54) delivered in 3 fractions (range 25/75% 3-5) with a median BED of 100Gy10 (range 25/75% 81-136). Median OS for the entire group was 26 months, with actuarial 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS of 74.1%, 33.3, and 21.8%, respectively. Patients with head and neck and breast cancers had longer median OS of 37 and 32 months respectively, compared to colorectal (30 months) and lung (26 months) which corresponded to 3-year actuarial OS of 51.8 and 47.9% for head and neck and breast respectively, compared to 35.8% for colorectal and 31.2% for lung. The median LC for all patients was 53 months, with actuarial 1-, 3-, and 5-year LC rates of 80.4, 58.9, and 46.3%, respectively. There was no difference in LC by primary histologic type (p = 0.49). Improved LC was observed for lung metastases that received SBRT doses of BED ≥100Gy10 with 3-year LC rate of 77.1% compared to 45% for lung metastases treated with BED < 100Gy10 (p = 0.01). Smaller tumor volumes (<11 cc) had improved LC compared to tumor volumes > 11 cc. (p = 0.005) Two-year LC rates for tumor volumes < 11 cc, 11-27 cc and > 27 cc were 72.9, 64.2 and 45.6%, respectively. This correlated with improved OS with 2-year OS rates of 62.4, 60.9 and 46.2% for tumor volumes < 11 cc, 11-27 cc and > 27 cc, respectively (p = 0.0023). In a subset of patients who received BED ≥100Gy10, 2-year LC rates for tumor volumes < 11 cc, 11-27 cc and > 27 cc were 82.8, 58.9 and 68.6%, respectively (p = 0.0244), and 2-year OS rates were 66.0, 58.8 and 28.5%, respectively (p = 0.0081).

CONCLUSION:

Excellent OS and LC is achievable with SBRT utilizing BED ≥100Gy10 for lung metastases according to the RSSearch® Registry data. Patients with small lung metastases (volumes < 11 cc) had better LC and OS when using SBRT doses of BED ≥100Gy10. Further studies to evaluate a difference, if any, between various tumor types will require a larger number of patients.

/vaccines during radiotherapy

/pneumovax

If you are about to undergo chemotherapy or radiotherapy, ideally you should be immunised 4-6 weeks before commencing treatment. (http://patient.info/health/pneumococcal-immunisation)

/pneumovax II

However, it is recommended that this vaccine is given at least two weeks before starting treatment with therapies that suppress the immune system, eg chemotherapy, radiotherapy, long-term high-dose corticosteroids, or immunosuppressants. This is because once the immune system is suppressed by these treatments, sufficient numbers of antibodies may not be produced in response to the vaccine.

The vaccine should particularly be avoided during radiotherapy or chemotherapy treatment. The immune response may also still be reduced after chemotherapy or radiotherapy has finished and the vaccine should therefore not be given within three months of finishing such treatment (possibly longer if the treatment was intensive or prolonged).

This vaccine must not be given at the same time as the shingles vaccine (Zostavax).

This vaccine may be given at the same time as the influenza (flu) vaccine, but different injection sites should be used.

/zostavax /zoster /vzv vaccine, /shingles 

Contraindications to zoster vaccine are:

Acquired or primary immune deficiency states, including AIDS

Cancer chemotherapy or radiotherapy

Leukemia

Lymphoma

/influenza vaccine

Ideally, influenza vaccine should be given at least 10 to 14 days before the start of any immune-suppressing cancer treatment, to allow for sufficient antibody production by the patient. If the patient is actively receiving chemotherapy, the vaccine should be ideally administered when blood counts are near the normal range. If this is not possible, the patient can still be immunized during a course of chemotherapy or radiotherapy, based on individual clinical judgment incorporating a patient's overall clinical situation. 

http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/physicalsideeffects/infectionsinpeoplewithcancer/should-i-get-a-flu-shot

Can I get a flu shot during cancer treatment?
Yes, people getting cancer treatment (for instance, radiation or chemotherapy) should get a flu shot. Treatment often causes them to have weak immune systems, which puts them at higher risk of serious and even life-threatening problems if they get the flu.

Many people with cancer worry that the flu shot will make them sick or react with other drugs they are taking. Talk to your cancer doctor about this – he or she knows your situation best.

Interaction between Radiation Therapy and Targeted Therapies in HER2-Positive Breast Cancer: 
Kamel Debbi, Cancers (Basel). 2023
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10137001/
Purpose: Over the past twenty years, anti-HER2 targeted therapies have proven to be a revolution in the management of human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancers. Anti-HER2 therapies administered alone or in combination with chemotherapy have been specifically studied. Unfortunately, the safety of anti-HER2 therapies in combination with radiation remains largely unknown. Thus, we propose a literature review of the risks and safety of combining radiotherapy with anti-HER2 therapies. We will focus on the benefit/risk rationale and try to understand the risk of toxicity in early-stage and advanced breast cancer. Methods: Research was carried out on the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, ClinicalTrial.gov, Medline, and Web of Science for the terms “radiotherapy”, “radiation therapy”, “radiosurgery”, “local ablative therapy”, and “stereotactic”, combined with “trastuzumab”, “pertuzumab”, “trastuzumab emtansine”, “TDM-1”, “T-Dxd”, “trastuzumab deruxtecan”, “tucatinib”, “lapatinib”, “immune checkpoint inhibitors”, “atezolizumab”, “pembrolizumab”, “nivolumab”, “E75 vaccine”, “interferon”, “anti-IL-2”, “anti-IL 12”, and “ADC”. Results: Association of radiation and monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab (with limited data) seems to be safe, with no excess risk of toxicity. Preliminary data with radiation and of antibody–drug conjugate of trastuzumab combined cytotoxic (trastuzumab emtansine, trastuzumab deruxtecan), given the underlying mechanism of action, suggest that one must be particularly cautious with the association. The safety of the combination of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (lapatinib, tucatinib) and radiation remains under-studied. The available evidence suggests that checkpoint inhibitors can be safely administrated with radiation. Conclusions: HER2-targeting monoclonal antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors can be combined with radiation, apparently with no excess toxicities. Caution is required when associating radiation with TKI and antibody drugs, considering the limited evidence.

T-DM1 trastuzumab emtansine
In the KATHERINE trial (see breast, neoadjuv.txt):
A moderate increase in the radiation-induced pneumonitis rate was observed in patients receiving T-DM1 (1.5%) compared to those receiving trastuzumab (0.7%). Similar rates of radiation-related cutaneous complication rates were noted in 25.4% and 27.6% of patients on the T-DM1 and the trastuzumab arms, respectively 

In a separate subset analysis of KATHERINE by Mamounas https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annonc.2021.04.011  :
Pulmonary toxicity occurred only in this (RT) group, and the incidence was higher with T-DM1 than with trastuzumab (3.4% versus 1.0%).
The rate of symptomatic (i.e. grade 2 or higher) radiation pneumonitis in KATHERINE (1.3%) was consistent with the symptomatic radiation pneumonitis incidence of approximately 1%-4% reported with radiotherapy and other systemic therapies for breast cancer.
(Per Mamounas,) These data suggest that T-DM1 and adjuvant radiotherapy can be administered concomitantly without a substantial increase in pulmonary toxicity. 

Debbi's opinion is (despite KATHERINE):
Considering the mechanism of action of T-DM1 (radiosensitization with microtubule inhibitors), and in the absence of strong safety data, concurrent radiation could be avoided, at least in cases where nodal irradiation is required.

3.4. Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd)
The DESTINY-Breast phase III trial compared the efficacy and safety of T-Dxd, an antibody–drug conjugate consisting of a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody linked to a topoisomerase I inhibitor payload, to T-DM1. T-Dxd improved both progression-free and overall survival compared to T-DM1. Given the fact that T-Dxd was associated with increased drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or 4 compared to T-DM1 (45.1% and 39.8%, respectively), extra caution is required with radiotherapy. Adjudicated drug-related interstitial lung disease or pneumonitis occurred in 10.5% of the patients in the T-Dxd group and in 1.9% of those in the T-DM1 group. There are limited data regarding the combination T-Dxd and radiation. Data suggest that regional breast irradiation increases the risk of pulmonary fibrosis. For example, in the EORTC study additional regional nodal irradiation was associated with an increased risk of pneumonitis compared to breast irradiation alone (4.4% in the nodal irradiation group vs. 1.7% in the control group, p < 0.001) [41]. Similarly, T-Dxd was associated with a significantly higher risk of pneumonitis. Moreover, gastrointestinal toxicities were more common with T-Dxd [42]. 

Therefore, caution is required with the combination of T-Dxd and thoracic or abdominal radiation.

For risk of CNS toxicity, the DEBBRAH phase II study showed that intracranial activity of T-Dxd and radiation is feasible with manageable toxicity in patients with HER2-positive and HER2-low breast cancer who received mainly WBRT and/or stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). However, the authors did not mention the timing between irradiation and sequential administration of T-Dxd [43].




/Dental

From Dr Heidi Hansen, DMD, Prov:


I reviewed with the patient the potential acute and chronic oral/dental sequelae of head and neck radiation therapy to include: oral mucositis, dysgeusia, ageusia, dermatitis, trismus, acute and chronic orofacial pain, and hyposalivation / xerostomia. I also discussed with the patient the risk for development of radiation caries, periodontal disease, and osteoradionecrosis. Risk of developing ORN is reported in areas of the bone receiving > 50-60 Gy (Wahl MJ. Osteoradionecrosis prevention myths. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys 2006.) The risk of osteoradionecrosis in all sites is 5.4% with RT alone and 6.3% with chemoRT(MASCC/ISOO 2011). The importance of maintaining a healthy dentition and practicing excellent oral hygiene including the use of a fluoride dentifrice, as well as the impact of sugar consumption on caries development, were explained to the patient. Prevalence of dental caries in patients treated with cancer therapies have been reported as 37.3% for chemotherapy alone, 24% post-radiotherapy, and 21.4% post chemotherapy and radiotherapy (Hong CHL. A systematic review of dental disease in patients undergoing cancer therapy. Supportive Care Cancer 2010). In addition, the patient was instructed to limit sugar consumption between meals, and made aware that henceforth, it is essential to undergo frequent (recommended three times a year) dental/oral examination and prophylaxis. The patient's questions were answered and an understanding was expressed.

From UpToDate 2023 06 14:

Safety of radiation therapy for malignancy in patients with rheumatologic disease — Some studies, including case series, have suggested that patients with systemic rheumatic diseases, especially those with systemic sclerosis (SSc; scleroderma) and possibly those with systemic lupus erythematosus, are at greater risk compared with patients without these disorders for toxic effects from radiotherapy used to treat malignant conditions [75-78]. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) do not appear at greater risk.

However, the small size of studies in the literature and variability in the results between studies prevents firm conclusions, and where an association has been suggested, the increased risk appears small compared with patients without these disorders. Based upon the data available, even SSc, for which the evidence is strongest, does not appear to be a contraindication to radiotherapy in all patients, and treatment decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis with careful consideration of the overall balance of the potential risks and benefits of therapy in the individual patient.

A 2006 systematic review found methodologic shortcomings in most studies and failed to demonstrate convincingly that patients with connective tissue disorders are at increased risk for late radiation-related toxic effects [79]. The risks associated with each specific connective tissue disorder were not analyzed. Similar conclusions were reached in a subsequent retrospective study of 20 SSc patients [80]; the short- and long-term rate of severe toxicity was not significantly higher compared with other patient cohorts receiving radiotherapy, and there were no severe acute skin reactions. There were no cases in which radiotherapy was believed to have exacerbated SSc, and the preponderance of deaths was related to the underlying malignancy rather than to SSc. In a subsequent multicenter, retrospective study of 153 SSc patients with breast cancer, 69 patients were treated with radiation therapy [81]. Up to 50 percent of the patients developed localized cutaneous fibrosis in the radiation port. However, generalized flares of SSc skin or lung disease were not observed, suggesting that radiation therapy for breast cancer could be considered a treatment option for SSc patients in the context of a multidisciplinary discussion and shared decision-making to explore the informed patient's preferences.
