SCORAD III: Randomized noninferiority phase III trial of single-dose radiotherapy (RT) compared to multifraction RT in patients (pts) with metastatic spinal canal compression (SCC).
800x1 vs 400x5
poor prognosis pts with median survival ~13 weeks.
primary outcome measure was ambulatory status. p=NS.
did not measure pain relief?


https://radiopaedia.org/articles/epidural-spinal-cord-compression-scale?lang=us
Bilsky Scale for ESCC 
The scale is nominally a 4-point scale, but grade 1 is further subdivided into 1a, 1b and 1c, making it a 6-point scale in practice 1. Increasing grades denote increasing degrees of stenosis:

grade 0: bone-only disease

grade 1: epidural extension without cord compression
1a: epidural extension only (no deformation of the thecal sac)
1b: deformation of the thecal sac, without spinal cord abutment
1c: deformation of the thecal sac, with spinal cord abutment

grade 2: spinal cord compression, with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) visible around the cord

grade 3: spinal cord compression, no CSF visible around the cord

Prognostication of Survival in Patients With Advanced Cancer: Predicting the Unpredictable

David Hui, MD, MSc

Table 3 has 3 prognostic models for survival for cancer pts:

Hui says: "Few web-based prognostication programs are available...thus, web based programs should be developed...Existing programs (eg, Prognostat) have limited use."

Osteoblastic: breast, prostate

Osteolytic Bone Metastases:

//BLTKP:  BLT with a Kosher Pickle, Mustard, & Mayo

Breast, Lung, Lymphoma, Thyroid, Kidney, Prostate, Multiple Myeloma

/BoneMets /bone mets  

 partial pain relief in 50-80% of pts. complete relief in 25%.

Onset 4 weeks. Median duration 12 weeks.

Short Course:

700 x 1 = 700

800 x 1 = 800

400 x 5 = 2000

400 x 6 = 2400 (Dutch RCT)

300 x 10 = 3000

High Dose: 250 x 15 = 3750, 200 x 20 = 4000

How does RT help bone met pain?

Relief often seen <24hrs, so anti-inflammatory effect (cytokines) probably more important than tumor cell kill.  

reduces cytokines, effect on osteoclasts, direct effect to nerves

RANK signaling pathway (receptor activation of nuclear factor kappaB)

TGF-beta

/denosumab /Xgeva or /Prolia - a RANK Ligand inhibitor, indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) in adult patients with bone metastases from solid tumors. SREs include pathological fractures, radiation or surgery to the bone, and spinal cord compression related to cancer. Denosumab is not indicated for the prevention of skeletal-related events in patients with multiple myeloma.

 osteoclasts

 

PET can’t detect pure blastic lesions as well as Bone Scan.

WFRT: too toxic to bone marrow, so don't do anymore.

Update on the Systematic Review of Palliative Radiotherapy Trials for Bone Metastases, Clinical Oncology, March 2012
http://www.sciencedirect.com.liboff.ohsu.edu/science/article/pii/S0936655511009058

From the ASTRO Bone Mets Guideline:

There are some situations in which alternative treatment schedules should be considered:  

1) in patients where the need for retreatment would be problematic, 

2) in patients with previous treatment to the spine, 

3) in those with femoral axial cortical involvement greater than 3 cm in length,

4) in those who have undergone a surgical stabilization procedure, and 

5) in those patients with spinal cord compression, cauda equina compression or radicular nerve pain.

1016 pts

270 X 15, 300 X 10, 300 X 5, 400 X 5, 500 X 5 (if no cord in field)

No diff in pain relief between fx schedules.

On Re-analysis:  

Blitzer, Cancer 1985;55:1468–72

Longer fx did better: 270x15, 300x10 were better.

But now we have this study:

RTOG /9714, Hartsell, JNCI 2005, "DOI: 10.1093/jnci/dji139"

for simple bone mets from breast/ prostate. up to 3 painful sites.

949pts

800x1 vs 300x10.

Overall response rate 66%. (17% get complete relief). 10% progressed.

Similar pain and narcotic relief at 3 months.

Worse acute toxicity in 300x10 arm, 17% v 10%.  

No diff in late toxicity.

Retreatment rate higher in 800x1 arm (18% v 9%). Is it less durable? or maybe cuz it's easy to do (JH)

But higher fracture rate in 800x1 (5% vs 4%)

(Konski did a CEA of 9714 and found that the ICER of longer/shorter schedule was $6973/QALY. AJCO 2009, PMID 19546803)

No diff in pain relief (if allowed up to 4x re-RT in SF arm).

BUT, single fraction (SF) group had

 higher retreatment rate (24% v 6%)

 more pathologic fractures (4% v 2%)

Median duration of relief: 18-19 wks

/Dutch Bone Metastasis Study - LONG LE subset: >12 mo survival

/Meeuse, Cancer 2010, "DOI: 10.1002/cncr.25062"

274 pts in this subset analysis who died <12 wks.

45% responded.  Of these average pain score 7 -> 5.

No diff between 800x1 v 400x6.

800x1 vs 300x10 for painful bone mets

No diff in pain relief at 4 mos.

No diff in fatigue, QoL.

Ryu does 16-18 Gy x 1 for spine mets.

Spinal cord mets: Holland has done 800 x 2, 1 week apart.

If short LE, poor KPS, widespread dz, favor shorter courses.

Bone Mets for Pathologic Fractures:

wt bearing bones

if >50% cortical bone destruction, see orthopod for hardware.

JH says treat ALL HARDWARE, cuz of tumor seeding.  

Alternative:

/bisphosphonates – for pain relief from bone mets, inhibits bone resorption by inhibiting osteoclast apoptosis. TOXICITIES: ONJ (osteonecrosis of jaw), especially from IV bisphosphonates

Oral: alendronate (Fosamax), Risedronate (Actonel)

Risedronate (Actonel) - fewer GI toxicities.  Monthly oral dosing. Still must sit upright 30-60 min.

/ibandronate (Boniva) - once monthly dosing. But reduction in hip fracture risk has not been demonstrated.

/Zometa IV /Aclasta (/Zoledronic acid, /Zolendronate): Risks: ONJ (osteonecrosis of jaw), renal failure.  - once yearly IV dosing

Anabolic bone agents:

Forteo (Teriparatide)

/ABCSG-12 (ASCO 2008, Plenary LBA4) For PREmenop, showed ZOL (Zometa 4mg q6mo) improved improved DFS (HR 0.64), RFS.

For premenop.

All got goserelin for ovarian suppression.

2x2 design:

Arimidex vs Tam, +/-ZOL

Findings: For premenop, AI was not better than Tam. (maybe cuz underpowered, or ovarian suppression is dominant)

ZOL may work by direct antitumor activity and/or immune activation.

Commentary: No Her2 status, Goserelin is not standard, underpowered for AI question.

Wong, R: did a Cochrane systematic review in 2002 of 30 RCTs.
