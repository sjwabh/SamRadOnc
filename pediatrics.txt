Try to avoid RT in age<3 cuz of severe neurocognitive defects.

/NBL /Neuroblastoma - a PNET,   NBL ^^VMA

2yo boy (35% <1yo)

NBL is the MC extracranial solid tumor in infancy.

-malignancy of sympathetic nervous system from neuroblasts

-paraspinal & adrenal medulla

(abdomen (adrenal) 40%, spinal ganglion 25%, thorax 15%, pelvis 5%)

-90% before age 5, median age 2 yrs

M>F, neurofibromatosis,

Sx: abd mass, catecholamine release.

Blueberry muffin babies from blue subq mets (Stage IVS)

Pepper syndrome: massive liver mets, respiratory compromise.

Hutchinson Syndrome: widespread bone metastases.

Horner's syndrome.

WORKUP:

Urine catecholamines (VMA, HVA) (>90%) (similar to pheo, but pheo has ^NE, NBL has ^VMA), FERRITIN, BMBx (clumps, pseudorosettes), abd MRI preferred over CTa (60-70% have calcifications on CT, vs only 5-10% on WT),

/MIBG NBL

MRI: tumors that cross midline or move w/ respiration are more likely to be NBL.

70% are metastatic at presentation.

Only treat mets if can be seen on MIBG post chemo, pre-transplant.

Prognostic Factors: Age<1.5 (good) and Stage are most significant!

Favorable:

age < 18 mos

TRKA (Tyrosine Kinase A)

hyperdiploid

opsoclonus/myoclonus.

nonrhythmic horizontal and vertical oscillations of the eyes

Unfavorable:

N-MYC amplification (25% of all cases)

Chr 1p36 LOH,

^ Ferritin

DNA aneuploidy (too low or too high?)

    High VMA/HVA ratio

/NBL Staging Systems: INSS, POG, Evans/D'Angio

INSS

I complete resection

II

 A incomplete resection, N-

 B          N+

III unresectable, crosses midline

IV distant mets

IVs: liver, skin, <10% BM, age<1yo

Stage I: Localized tumor w/ complete gross resection, negative nodes

Stage IIA: Localized tumor w/ incomplete resection, negative nodes

Stage IIB: Localized tumor w/ positive ipsilateral non-adherent nodes

Stage III: Unresectable unilateral tumor infiltrating across midline,

       or unresectable midline tumor w/ bilateral extension

Stage IV: Distant spread

Stage IVS: Localized primary (Stage I or II) w/ dissemination limited to skin, liver, <10% bone marrow, and age < 1 y/o. (can spontaneously regress!)

The POG staging system is both easier to remember and more importantly easier to distinguish from the Wilm’s tumor system which Woo says people always mix up!

Stage A- positive margins

Stage B- gross disease

Stage C- positive LNs

Stage D- hematogenous mets

Stage Ds- skin, liver or bone marrow mets.  

Histology: (Shimada classification)

1. differentiation (diff, undiff)

2. (stroma-rich vs stroma-poor)

    spindle cell stroma?

3. MKI: mitosis-karyorrhexis index (cellular proliferation)

4. nodular pattern (yes/no)

5. age (<18 mos, < 5yo)

 Favorable (Shimada) (any of the following):

   stroma rich AND not nodular

   age < 18mos AND MKI  < 200/5000

   age < 5 yrs AND MKI < 100/5000 AND well-differentiated

 UNfavorable (any of the following):

/VACD-IE

Recently, it was reported that the addition of ifosfamide and etoposide (IE) to previous standard chemotherapy regimens contributed significantly to improvements in clinical outcome for patients with nonmetastatic ESFT of bone.[6] Of 202 patients without metastasis at presentation, 201 patients received chemotherapy. Of these, 45 patients who received chemotherapy regimens that included (IE) (vincristine, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin [/VACD] plus IE-based regimens; T-16, EVAIA, KS-1) (see Table 1) had significantly better EFS (5-year EFS rate, 67.6%) compared with the other patients (n = 156 patients; 5-year EFS rate, 41.2%; P = .0054 [log-rank test] and P = .010 [Wilcoxon test]) (Fig. 2). Moreover, of the various chemotherapy regimens, we compared outcomes of nonmetastatic patients who received 2 typical regimens, the T-11 protocol (see Table 1) and VACD plus IE-based regimens. The results indicated that patients who received VACD plus IE-based regimens had significantly better EFS (n = 32 patients; 5-year EFS rate, 67.3%) than patients who received the T-11 protocol (n = 43 patients; 5-year EFS rate, 41.6%; P = .032 [log-rank test] and P = .041 [Wilcoxon test]).

"Results of the EICESS-92 Study: two randomized trials of Ewing's sarcoma treatment--cyclophosphamide compared with ifosfamide in standard-risk patients and assessment of benefit of etoposide added to standard treatment in high-risk patients."

For STANDARD RISK,

VACD vs VAID (Cytoxan vs Ifosfamide)

Results: substituting Ifosfamide for Cyclophosphamide has same efficacy w/ less toxicity.

For HIGH RISK,

Results: Adding Etoposide reduced risk 15-17%.

contraindications:   diffuse vitreous seeding

Note much lower than the Melanoma dose and therefore, less common complications

very effective

rare complications – b/c dose is so much lower than with melanoma, optic neuropathy & retinopathy is unusual

plaque advantages over EBRT: does not produce orbital bone hypoplasia

no increased risk of orbital bone sarcoma

EBRT

Reese-Ellsworth grouping system predicts probability of success

advantage over other local therapies is that recovery of adjacent retina may occur with shrinkage of tumor

may  ability to save the eye & vision, but may  OS 2/2 increased risk of 2nd tumors

not used much anymore

indications: tumor at fovea/macula where central vision would be destroyed by photocoagulation

large tumors for which other local therapies are ineffective

salvage therapy after more focal therapies have failed

extensive vitreous seeding

post-enucleation for (1) positive optic nerve margin (caution – nerve may retract back into optic foramen)

(2) extraocular extension

(3) prior intraocular procedure

field = whole orbit with anterior & lateral oblique wedge pair

dose = 50-54 Gy

brain or meningeal extension (entire cranial-spinal axis)

palliation of distant mets

anterior-lateral wedge pair technique

most widely used approach

attempts to treat the entire retina while protecting the lens

uses a central divergent hanging block in the anterior field to spare the lens; however, block is omitted when tumor is located at the posterior pole

weighting is usually 4:1 lateral:anterior with the anterior dose attempting to supplement dose to the anterior retina that may be compromised by the lateral field

treatment borders

lateral portal: same as above except that the anterior border is placed at the bony canthus

anterior portal: 1 cm margin around entire bony orbit

treatment borders

anterior: 2 – 3 mm posterior to soft tissue canthus

posterior: 1 cm posterior to posterior orbital cone

superior: 1 cm superior to superior orbital wall

inferior: 1 cm inferior to inferior orbital wall

Eye preservation rates: 60-90%

Visual preservation rates (see R-E staging): By R-E stage: >95%, ,65%, <50%, poor

Side effects of EBRT: dermatitis, lid ectropion (cyst under eyelid), pingueculum (a yellowish patch on the white (sclera) of the eye. Found between the eyelids, it is most often on the nasal side),

secondary malignancies, dry eye (mebovian glands in lid), neovascular glaucoma, vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, cataract
