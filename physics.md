/Internal Conversion - gamma ray from nucleus is absorbed by k-shell electron, which gets ejected. competes w/ gamma emission.

   | IC

PHOTON interactions:

/Rayleigh (coherent) scatter    |

proportional to Z

/Photoelectric Capture

 entire energy of incident photon transmitted to ejected inner electron,

 strongly dependent on atomic number (Z^3/E^3)

/Compton Scatter (100 keV - 10 MeV, pure 100-150 KeV)

 interaction w/ outer shell e-

 dependent on e- density (Na * Z / Aw) (nearly constant), independent of Z

/Pair Production

 proportional to Z^2

/Triplet production

 proportional to Z

/Photodisintegration – neutron production from Linacs above 15x

/Exposure - X  (1 R = 2.58x10^-4 C/Kg) = amount of electrical charges of all ions in a unit volume of air.  It is the ionization equivalent of collision kerma in air, only defined up to 3MV.

 

/Absorbed Dose (/Gy /Gray) - energy absorbed in the medium during the second stage of energy transfer from e- to the medium. (some is lost to Brehmstralung)

(requires buildup region)

Does not differentiate between types of medium or types of radiation.

(1 R = 0.876 cGy)

/Kerma (Gy)- kinetic energy transferred from the photon to primary e- at the INITIAL interaction.

(max at surface, no buildup region)

absorbed dose is > collision kerma after Dmax, where "transient electronic equilibrium" is established (similar to transient equilibrium for radioactive decay).

/Delta Rays – secondary electrons – can carry a significant portion of energy away from the interaction site.

/Equivalent Dose, /Sievert, /Sv  = Amount of biologic damage produced.

Used when comparing different types of radiation.  

Used to quantify radiation exposure to personnel in working environment.

Equivalent dose = Absorbed Dose x Weighting Factor

Sv = Quality Factor x Gy

/WF

Weighting Factor

radiation weighting factor, WR:

represents the relative biological effectiveness of various types of radiation determined by a committee

WF is not the same as RBE

/Effective Dose (also Sievert) = Equivalent Dose x TissueFactor

Tissue Factor - accounts for parts of the body exposed, total adds up to 1

/GSD – genetically significant dose

Diagnostic X-rays are most significant contributor.

/Activity (1 /Bequerel = 1 disintegrations per second, dps):

/Ci

1 Ci = 3.7 x 10^10 dps (Bq)

/Specific Activity, SA: activity per unit mass

 SA = lambda * (Na / Aw)

 Na: Avogadro's number

 Aw: atomic weight

/mean life = average life = T1/2 / ln2 = 1.44 * T1/2

Total Dose = InitialDose * MeanLife

Decay Constant, or

/Exposure Rate Constant = Capital Gamma = 8.25 R*cm^2/(mCi*hr) for 1 mg Ra equiv of any radionuclide.

for brachytherapy

Exposure (X) = (Gamma x Activity x Time )/ d^2

“If you stand for 3 hrs at 1 meter from a 5 mCi source for which Gamma=2, you will be exposed to 3 mR.”

Gamma for Cs is 3.26

/air kerma strength, Sk (cGy cm^2 / hr)

The reference air kerma rate K is the kerma rate to air at a distance of 1 m from the source, corrected for air attenuation and scattering. It has the units of cGh/hr at 1 m. Tbis quantity is proportional to the activity of the source.

/Equilibrium

None Tparent << Tdaughter 131-Te     -> 131-I

Secular Tparent >> Tdaughter 226-Radium -> 222-Radon

 Ad=Ap

Transient Tparent >  Tdaughter 99-Mo     -> 99-Tc

 Ad=Ap *(Tp/(Tp-Td))

Absorbed Dose - 2 ways to measure directly:

Calorimetry - (heat changes, most accurate: 1 cal = 4.18 J)

Fricke (Ferrous Sulfate) - (chemical changes: Fe2+ to Fe3+)

Solid State

/TLD uses LiF, 3-5% accuracy

/Film: 3% accuracy

/Roentgen

Dose(air)(cGy) = 0.876 * X (Roentgen)

common doses:

CT 1-6 cGy

CXR .01 to .07 cGy

air travel: .005 cGy/hr

/HVL = ln2/mu

mu = linear attenuation coefficient

I=Io exp(-mu x)

TVL = tenth value layer

TVL = 3.32 * HVL

mu/rho = mass attenuation coefficient

rho (for lead) = 1135 kg/m3

SDD: Source Diaphragm Distance - from source to collimator blocks

/LET = SI * W

/SI = specific ionization: # ionizations per unit length

 increases w/ increasing charge of incident particle

 increases w/ decreasing velocity of incident particle

W = average energy to produce ion pair (usually ~33.97 eV for dry air @STP)
