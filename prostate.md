From UpToDate 2023:

Dose of radiation — For most males, we suggest a minimum radiation dose of 66 Gy for salvage RT.

The evidence for the appropriate dose of radiation in the postoperative setting is much less robust than in the definitive setting. There are large retrospective series and two randomized trials that help to inform practice:

●A large meta-analysis of more than 10,000 patients from 71 retrospective series with median follow-up 52 months concluded that doses above 70 Gy were more efficacious [24].

●Another retrospective analysis of 1108 patients treated at 10 centers came to similar conclusions [25]. The cohort was limited to patients who had margin-positive disease at radical prostatectomy, had a serum PSA ≤2 ng/mL, and did not receive neoadjuvant or concurrent androgen suppression. For patients treated with <66 Gy, the 5- and 10-year rates of biochemical recurrence were 40.6 and 56.9 percent, respectively. In contrast, for those treated with 66 to 69.9 Gy, the 5- and 10-year rates of biochemical recurrence were 34.3 and 42.3 percent, respectively; for those treated with ≥70 Gy, the rates were 28.5 and 38.6 percent, respectively. On multivariate analysis, the differences for those treated with ≥66 Gy were significantly different from those treated with <66 Gy.

There are two published randomized trials evaluating radiation dose in the postoperative setting that are also relevant; neither showed an advantage for higher doses than 64 to 66 Gy [26-29]:

•The multicenter Swiss SAKK 09/10 trial compared 64 with 70 Gy in the salvage-RT setting in 350 males with a rising PSA after radical prostatectomy at least 12 weeks previously and no evidence of macroscopic disease. In an initial report [27], the higher dose was associated with slightly higher acute urinary symptoms and patient-reported quality of life, but a subsequent analysis revealed no difference in urinary incontinence according to dose [26].

At a median follow-up of 6.2 years, there was no difference in the six-year freedom from biochemical progression rate with higher-dose RT (61.3 versus 62.3 percent, HR for biochemical progression 1.14, 95% CI 0.82-1.60), and there were also no differences in clinical progression-free survival, time to hormonal treatment, or overall survival [30]. Higher-dose therapy was associated with significantly higher rates of late grade 2 or 3 gastrointestinal toxicity. The authors concluded that conventional dose salvage RT to the prostate bed is sufficient for individuals with early biochemical progression after RP.

•A Chinese randomized controlled trial compared 66 with 72 Gy in patients with a biochemical recurrence following prostatectomy [28]. One hundred and forty-four patients were enrolled. The primary endpoint was biochemical progression-free survival, and the median follow-up was 48 months. There was no difference in four-year biochemical progression-free survival between the 66 and 72 Gy cohorts (75.9 versus 82.6 percent; p = 0.299). An unplanned subgroup analysis did observe improved biochemical progression-free survival for the 72 Gy group with Gleason scores of 8 to 10. No differences in acute or late grade 2+ genitourinary or gastrointestinal toxicity were observed.

High-grade (Gleason score 8 to 10) prostate cancer with a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA; ≤2.5 mg/mL) appears to comprise a distinct but uncommon subset that includes the small cell and large cell prostatic neuroendocrine carcinomas [54]. In such cases, the Gleason score is assigned to the adenocarcinoma component, which in 85 percent of cases, is Gleason >8 [55]. This disease subset typically is aggressive and relatively hormone resistant [56-58]. (

In the overall NCDB series, 0.7 percent of patients had Gleason 8 to 10 disease and a PSA ≤2.5 ng/dL. Among those with Gleason 8 to 10 disease, 6 percent had a PSA ≤2.5 ng/dL.

●In the SEER database, prostate cancer-specific mortality was higher for males with a PSA ≤2.5 ng/dL and Gleason 8 to 10 adenocarcinomas compared with the reference group of those with a PSA 4.1 to 10 ng/dL at diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR] 2.70), and it was similar to that for males with high-grade disease and a PSA >20 ng/dL (HR 2.56 compared with the reference group). The adjusted prostate cancer-specific mortality rate at 47 months after diagnosis was 14 percent in the high-grade, low-PSA subset, compared with 4.9 percent in those with a PSA >2.5 ng/dL.

●Among males with high-grade disease and a low PSA treated with radiation therapy, the use of androgen deprivation therapy was associated with an overall survival benefit for those with a PSA >2.5 ng/dL but not for those with a PSA ≤2.5 ng/dL.

●In GRID, males with a low PSA and high-grade disease were more likely to have a neuroendocrine/small cell pattern compared with those with high-grade disease and a PSA >2.5 ng/dL. (See "Molecular prognostic tests for prostate cancer", section on 'Genomic classifier (Decipher)'.)

/PSA Bounce – The bounce phenomenon occurs in a third to half of men treated with radiation for prostate cancer.  More likely after brachy (84%) than EBRT (58%) (Pickles, Red 2006).  And bounce may actually be a good prognostic sign (??).

Horwitz, ASTRO 2004, showed that PSA bounce doesn’t translate to increased mortality, but it does indicate lower PSA control(?).  Concludes that you don’t need to necessarily start hormones at the first PSA bounce.

Clinical utility of the percentage of positive prostate biopsies in defining biochemical outcome after radical prostatectomy for patients with clinically localized prostate cancer.

J Clin Oncol. 2000;18(6):1164.

The influence of prostate biopsy tumor volume on outcome was illustrated by a report of 960 surgically treated men, in which 80 percent of those in the intermediate-risk group (clinical stage T2b, biopsy Gleason grade 7 [grade group 2 or 3], or preoperative serum prostate specific antigen [PSA] between 10 and 20 ng/mL) could be classified into two separate risk groups based upon the fraction of prostate biopsies that were found to contain cancer [18]:

●Patients with >50 percent positive biopsies had an 11 percent likelihood of PSA control at four years.

●Patients with <34 percent positive biopsies had an 86 percent likelihood of PSA control at four years.

 Always LND first, then RP if N-. /LND: common iliac, may need to sacrifice obturator n,a,v. Prostatic apex is the most difficult margin (& preserve sphincter), especially w/ retropubic approach (vs perineal approach).

 But In-Training 2005 Q298 says urethral anastomosis is MC site of recurrence.

 

Perineal approach: better exposure of urethral stump for anastomosis, but higher neuropraxis (dt lithotomy), higher rectal complic.

 

Retropubic approach: better nerve sparing?, but harder to get apex margin?

 

Don't need to remove SVs in an RP.

 

/Active Surveillance

• NCCN recommendations

• PSA q6m, DRE q12m

• Consider confirmatory biopsy within 6 months

• Consider MRI-US fusion biopsy

• Surveillance biopsy as often as annually

UCSF regimen

• PSA q3m, DRE/TRUS q6m

• Confirmatory biopsy within 12 months of diagnostic biopsy

• Surveillance biopsy q12-24 months based on clinical risk

AH Low Risk Prostate Teaching Statement:

 

I discussed in detail the treatment options for low-risk prostate cancer.

Specifically, I mentioned observation with or without hormonal therapy,

radical prostatectomy, prostate brachytherapy, and external beam radiation.

I discussed the expected life expectancy with observation based on the

Connecticut SEER data.  I discussed how radical prostatectomy has been

traditionally considered the gold standard for treatment.  I also mentioned

how more recent data in the era of dose escalation and prostate

brachytherapy indicates equivalent control rates for external beam,

brachytherapy, and surgery when matched stage for stage at large academic

centers.

 

I discussed the side effects of brachytherapy, specifically a 10 - 15%

chance of obstructive symptoms requiring, in the worst-case scenario,

self-catheterization.  I discussed the side effects of external beam

radiation, specifically a 10 - 14% chance of chronic rectal irritation

including a <3% chance of rectal wall bleeding.  I also discussed the

differing rates of incontinence and the near-equivalent rates of impotence with the various treatment options.

 

I was present during the history and examination of the patient.  I discussed the case with the resident, agree with the findings, and formulated the plan as documented in the resident's note.

AH Intermediate Risk Prostate Consult template (as of 2017 01 24):

We discussed in detail the treatment options for intermediate-risk prostate cancer. Specifically, we mentioned treatment with radical prostatectomy, prostate brachytherapy, and external beam radiation. We do not normally recommend active surveillance unless the life expectancy is expected to be less than 10 years based on SPCG-4. After 23 years of follow-up, the absolute difference in survival between observation and treatment was 11% with 8 being the number needed to treat to prevent one death. Also ADT was used in 25% fewer patients who underwent treatment. The benefit of treatment was greatest in men younger than 65 and in those with intermediate-risk prostate cancer (RR 0.38).

 

We discussed the recent ProtecT study. Between 1999 and 2009, a total of 82,429 men 50 to 69 years of age received a PSA test; 2664 received a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer of al risk groups. 1643 agreed to undergo randomization to active monitoring (545 men), surgery (553), or radiotherapy with 6 months of ADT (545). The primary outcome was prostate-cancer mortality at a median of 10 years of follow-up. Secondary outcomes included the rates of disease progression, metastases, and all-cause deaths. That study did not show an improvement in OS at 10 years. However, metastases developed in more men in the active-monitoring group (33 men; 6.3 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 4.5 to 8.8) than in the surgery group (13 men; 2.4 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.4 to 4.2) or the radiotherapy group (16 men; 3.0 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 1.9 to 4.9) (P=0.004 for the overall comparison). Higher rates of disease progression were seen in the active-monitoring group (112 men; 22.9 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 19.0 to 27.5) than in the surgery group (46 men; 8.9 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 6.7 to 11.9) or the radiotherapy group (46 men; 9.0 events per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 6.7 to 12.0) (P<0.001 for the overall comparison). The short follow-up limits our ability to know the true benefit of treatment.

  

Finally, we discussed the patient-reported outcomes from ProtecT. Of the three treatments, prostatectomy had the greatest negative effect on sexual function and urinary continence, and although there was some recovery, these outcomes remained worse in the prostatectomy group than in the other groups throughout the trial. The negative effect of radiotherapy on sexual function was greatest at 6 months, attributable to the ADT, but sexual function then recovered somewhat and was stable thereafter; radiotherapy had little effect on urinary continence. Sexual and urinary function declined gradually in the active-monitoring group. Bowel function was worse in the radiotherapy group at 6 months than in the other groups but then recovered somewhat, except for the increasing frequency of bloody stools; bowel function was unchanged in the other groups. Urinary voiding and nocturia were worse in the radiotherapy group at 6 months but then mostly recovered and were similar to the other groups after 12 months. Effects on quality of life mirrored the reported changes in function. No significant differences were observed among the groups in measures of anxiety, depression, or general health-related or cancer-related quality of life.

For intermediate-risk prostate cancer, the best data for the use of short-term androgen deprivation concurrent with radiation is from RTOG 9408. This phase III trial randomized 1979 patients to 4 months of total androgen suppression. After a median f/u period of 9.1 years, the 10-year rate of overall survival was 62% among patients receiving radiotherapy plus short-term ADT (the combined-therapy group), as compared with 57% among patients receiving radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death with radiotherapy alone, 1.17; P=0.03). The addition of short-term ADT was associated with a decrease in the 10-year disease-specific mortality from 8% to 4% (hazard ratio for radiotherapy alone, 1.87; P=0.001). Biochemical failure, distant metastases, and the rate of positive findings on repeat prostate biopsy at 2 years were significantly improved with radiotherapy plus short-term ADT. Reanalysis according to risk showed reductions in overall and disease-specific mortality primarily among intermediate-risk patients, with no significant reductions among low-risk patients. The intermediate-risk patients who received short-term ADT saw an increase in the 10-year rate of overall survival from 54 to 61% (hazard ratio for death with radiotherapy alone, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.49) and a reduction in the 10-year disease-specific mortality from 10 to 3% (hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.50 to 4.11).

If he chooses to proceed with external beam radiotherapy, we recommend a hypofractionated regimen to a total of 70Gy in 28 fractions. RTOG 0415 was a randomized Phase III trial the compared the disease-free survival rate of 1,115 men for two different treatment regimens: a shorter one of 70 Gy over 28 fractions vs. a longer, conventional fractionation, 73.8 Gy over 41 fractions. After 5.9 years median f/u, the trial demonstrated that the shorter treatment regimen was more convenient without compromising cure or causing additional side effects.

 

AH High Risk Prostate Consult template (as of 2016 03 11):

We discussed in detail the treatment options for high-risk prostate cancer as defined by NCCN guidelines: We discussed how the best current standard therapy is combined modality therapy consisting of concurrent androgen ablation and external beam radiation. We specifically mentioned the expected outcomes from the EORTC trial combining 2 years of androgen ablation with radiation demonstrating a survival benefit and a 5 year disease-free survival of 74%.

We discussed how surgery usually provides the best outcome when the disease is confined to the prostate. But in high-risk disease, the cancer is rarely confined to the prostate. The Partin Tables indicate that patients are likely to have high rates of extracapsular extension, seminal vesicle involvement and/or lymph node metastasis.

Surgery alone is possible for patients with high-risk features, but two randomized trials (SWOG 8794 and EORTC 22911) have demonstrated a significant benefit with the addition of adjuvant radiation for patients with any high-risk features found at the time of surgery. The 5-year disease free survival for surgery alone in this population of patients from the two trials was 40 - 50%. With the addition of radiation, the 5-year disease-free survival for surgery followed by adjuvant radiation is about 70 - 75%.

A Phase II Study of External Beam Radiation Therapy Combined with Permanent Source Brachytherapy for Intermediate Risk Clinically Localized Adenocarcinoma of the Prostate

/Lawton, Long Term Results of RTOG 0019, Red 2012

http://dx.doi.org.liboff.ohsu.edu/10.1016/j.ijrobp.2011.11.040

Results

One hundred thirty-eight patients were enrolled from 20 institutions, and 131 were eligible. Median follow-up (living patients) was 8.2 years (range, 2.7–9.3 years). The 8-year estimate of late grade >3 genitourinary and/or gastrointestinal toxicity was 15%. The most common grade >3 toxicities were urinary frequency, dysuria, and proctitis. There were two grade 4 toxicities, both bladder necrosis, and no grade 5 toxicities. In addition, 42% of patients complained of grade 3 impotence (no erections) at 8 years. The 8-year estimate of biochemical failure was 18% and 21% by the Phoenix and ASTRO consensus definitions, respectively.

Conclusion

Biochemical control for this treatment seems durable with 8 years of follow-up and is similar to high—dose external beam radiation alone or brachytherapy alone. Late toxicity in this multi-institutional trial is higher than reports from similar cohorts of patients treated with high—dose external-beam radiation alone or permanent low—doserate brachytherapy alone, perhaps suggesting further attention to strategies that limit doses to normal structures or to unimodal radiotherapy techniques.

From J Alum:

 

Based on the MSKCC nomogram, using Mr. C's current data, treatment with salvage XRT at this time without adjuvant ADT would provide a 23% progression free probability at 6 years. 

We discussed this with him and he would like to see radiation oncology for consideration as he is interested in treatment that would allow him to delay the need to start ADT. If he does elect to undergo salvage XRT we would recommend CT and bone scan prior to ensure he does not have any visible metastatic disease. 

For rising PSA only disease, we do not know whether early hormonal therapy improves outcomes (prostate-cancer specific-survival or overall survival), and this therapy is associated with significant side effects including hot flashes, change in mood/concentration, loss of libido, change in size of male sex organs, weight gain, fatigue, loss of bone mass, increased risk of cardiovascular events and strokes. I reviewed with him data from Pound, et al in JAMA 1999 and Freedland, et al JCO 2007. From the Pound cohort (at Johns Hopkins) of men with rising PSAs after surgery who were observed and not given hormonal therapy until the time of metastases, the median time to metastases was 8 years with no treatment. Following the development of metastases, the median time to death from prostate cancer was 5 years. 

Freedland, et al showed on these same patients, with longer follow-up, that the median time to death after biochemical relapse was 15 years. At 15 years, 10% of those with a PSA doubling time >15 months, 35% of those with a PSA doubling time between 9-14.9 months, 70% of those with a PSA doubling time between 3-8.9 months, and 80% of those with a PSA doubling time of <3 months died of prostate cancer. While those with the fastest doubling times clearly have more aggressive disease, it is not known whether there is a survival benefit to early hormonal therapy in these men, and, in the average man with biochemical recurrence, their median survival with hormonal therapy initiated only at the time of metastases is still greater than 6 years. Additionally, Trock, et al presented retrospective data at ASCO 2009 that showed that the groups who benefited from hormonal therapy for PSA recurrences after surgery were those with PSA recurrences within 2 years of surgery and whose PSA doubling time were less than 6 months. 

We also discussed salvage XRT given that he had T3b disease. Based on MSKCC calculator, he has a 19% chance of PSA control.

Enzalutamide is clinically active in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.[11] PSA level decreased more than 50 percent in 40/65 chemo-naive patients and 38/75 chemotherapy-treated patients.[11] Median time to radiographic progression was 56 weeks for chemo-naive patients and 25 weeks for the post-chemotherapy population.[12]

Medivation conducted an international phase III trial that began in September 2009 known as AFFIRM. The aim of this trial was determine the safety and effectiveness of enzalutamide in patients who have previously failed chemotherapy treatment with docetaxel.[13] In November 2011, this trial was halted after an interim analysis revealed that patients given the drug lived for approximately 5 months longer than those taking placebo.

FINASTERIDE reduced risk of all AcP by 25%, but initially thought to cause increased risk of high risk AcP (6.4% v 5%),

BUT new follow up study by Redman (Cancer Prevention Research 2008, "doi:10.1158/1940-6207.CAPR-08-0092") shows this is not true.

 

 

"Clinicians need to be aware that they should interpret PSA differently for men on dutasteride and finasteride than for men not taking those medicines."

He pointed out that there are 2 main points that physicians should be aware of when interpreting these results. "First, PSA levels generally will fall by about 50% within 6 months of starting dutasteride," he told Medscape Medical News. "But the magnitude of fall does not predict whether that man harbors prostate cancer. In the REDUCE [Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events] study, men who were never found to have cancer had the same initial PSA drop as men who were later found to have cancer — even high-grade cancer.

With a median follow-up of 5 years, the estimated progression-free survival rate (failure defined as prostate-specific antigen [PSA] greater than 0.5 ng/mL) was 65% for the men who received combination therapy and 42% for those treated by RT alone with hormones reserved for relapse (P = 0.002). Differences in the rates of freedom from biochemical relapse were observed when failure was defined as PSA of 1.0 to 3.9 ng/mL (71% versus 46%; P = 0.008) and PSA greater than 4.0 ng/mL (76% versus 55%; P = 0.05), respectively. No differences were observed between the groups with respect to the end points of local control, distant failure, and overall survival. The use of immediate androgen suppression (ie, LHRH agonists) and the absence of pathologic nodal involvement were independently associated with prolongation of freedom from biochemical relapse by multivariate analysis.

Patients with prostate cancer and indications for postoperative RT should be considered for combined RT and hormonal manipulation. Because statistically significant advantages for this experimental approach could not be defined for all end points studied (in particular, overall survival), efforts should be made to enroll these patients in the recently activated RTOG trial (96-01) comparing RT plus placebo to the combination of RT plus Casodex in the postoperative setting.

Abstract

To compare the biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) among patients receiving whole pelvic radiotherapy (WPRT) vs. prostate bed RT (PBRT) after radical prostatectomy.

Between 1985 and 2005, 160 patients underwent adjuvant or salvage RT after radical prostatectomy. A short course of total androgen suppression was also given concurrently to 87 patients. Of the 160 patients, 114 were considered at high risk of lymph node involvement because they had a pathologic Gleason score of >/=8, a preoperative prostate-specific antigen level >20 ng/mL, seminal vesicle or prostate capsule involvement, or pathologic lymph node involvement. Of this group, 72 underwent WPRT and 42 underwent PBRT. The median follow-up was >5 years for all patient subsets. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards multivariate analyses were performed for all clinical, pathologic, and treatment factors predicting for bRFS.

Whole pelvic RT resulted in superior bRFS compared with PBRT (p = 0.03). The advantage of WPRT was limited to high-risk patients, with a 5-year bRFS rate of 47% (95% confidence interval, 35-59%) after WPRT vs. 21% (95% confidence interval, 8-35%) after PBRT (p = 0.008). For low-risk patients, no difference (p = 0.9) was found. On multivariate analysis, only WPRT (p = 0.02) and a preoperative prostate-specific antigen level <1.0 ng/mL (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with bRFS. The benefit from total androgen suppression (TAS) with postoperative RT was only observed when given concurrently with WPRT (p = 0.04) and not with PBRT (p = 0.4).

The results of our study have indicated that WPRT confers superior bRFS compared with PBRT for high-risk patients receiving adjuvant or salvage RT after radical prostatectomy. This advantage was observed only with concurrent total androgen suppression (TAS). These results are analogous to the benefit from WPRT seen in the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 94-13 study.

CONCLUSION:

/Salvage HT. When do you add Hormones, HT, ADT for Salvage?



UpToDate: Given the available preliminary data from RTOG 9601 and from observational series, it is reasonable to recommend short-term ADT (four to six months) for men with very unfavorable risk factors at the time of radical prostatectomy (eg, iPSA>20 ng/mL, iGleason score ≥8)

Largely based on results from the RTOG 9601 trial, for patients with a detectable PSA above 0.6 ng/mL after radical prostatectomy, we suggest adding short-term ADT in conjunction with radiation therapy (RT). We use ADT for two months before and during salvage RT (six months total).

Factors supporting the use of ADT include the presence of extensive extracapsular disease, seminal vesicle involvement, and the presence of Gleason grade 8 to 10 tumor.

 UpToDate (2023): For individuals with a pre-RT PSA <0.6 ng/mL, there is no consensus on the value of ADT. The presence of high-risk features (Gleason >7, seminal vesicle involvement, and a PSA that never became undetectable) may provide support for use of ADT in such patients.
This recommendation is slightly different than updated guidelines from ASTRO/AUA, which recommend that clinicians offer ADT to males treated with salvage RT if the PSA is ≥0.2 ng/mL

Abstract

PURPOSE:

Salvage radiotherapy (SRT) after radical prostatectomy can potentially eradicate residual microscopic disease. Defining the optimal patient and treatment factors is essential and is particularly relevant within the context of adjuvant vs early vs delayed postoperative radiotherapy (RT).

METHODS AND MATERIALS:

A systematic review of all published SRT studies was performed to identify the pathologic, clinical, and treatment factors associated with relapse-free survival (RFS) after SRT. A total of 41 studies encompassing 5597 patients satisfied the study entry criteria. Radiobiologic interpretation of biochemical tumor control was used to provide the framework for the observed relationships.

RESULTS:

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level before SRT (P<.0001) and RT dose (P=.0052) had a significant and independent association with RFS. There was an average 2.6% loss of RFS for each incremental 0.1 ng/mL PSA at the time of SRT (95% CI, ∼2.2-3.1). With a PSA level of 0.2 ng/mL or less before SRT, the RFS approached 64%. The dose for salvage RT in the range of 60-70 Gy seemed to be on the steep part of the sigmoidal dose-response curve, with a dose of 70 Gy achieving 54% RFS compared with only 34% for 60 Gy. There was a 2% improvement in RFS for each additional Gy (95% CI, ∼0.9-3.2). The observed dose-response was less robust on sensitivity analysis.

CONCLUSIONS:

This study provides Level 2a evidence for initiating SRT at the lowest possible PSA. Dose escalation is also suggested by the data. Progressively better tumor control rates with SRT after radical prostatectomy are achieved with a lower PSA at initiation and with a higher RT dose. Early salvage RT may be an equivalent strategy to adjuvant RT.

/Node positive AcP:

Should we add RT to HT?

 

From AH:

Abdollah et al. retrospectively evaluated 1,107 patients with pN1 prostate cancer treated with radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection between 1988 and 2010. All patients received adjuvant hormonal therapy with or without adjuvant RT. After a multivariable analysis, adjuvant RT was associated with more favorable cancer-specific mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.37; p < .001). However, when patients were stratified into risk groups, only two groups of men benefited from adjuvant RT: (1) patients with positive lymph node (+LN) count of 2 or less, Gleason score 7 to 10, pT3b/pT4 stage, or positive surgical margins (HR, 0.30; P .002); and (2) patients with PLN count of 3 to 4 (HR, 0.21; P .02), regardless of other tumor characteristics. These results were confirmed when overall mortality was examined as an end point. This retrospective study helps us determine the beneficial impact of adjuvant RT on survival in patients with pN1 prostate cancer is highly influenced by tumor characteristics.

/Abdollah says only for those 2 above subgroups. (Why didn't RT help for Very Low and Low groups???)

Indications:

symptomatic bone metastases (at least 2) and no known visceral metastatic disease (except lymph nodes OK)

Contraindications:

Before 1st dose, the ANC should be ≥1.5 X 109/L, platelets ≥100 X 109/L and hemoglobin ≥10g/dL. Before subsequent doses, the ANC should be ≥1 X 109/L and platelets ≥50 X 109/L; discontinue if no recovery within 6–8 weeks after last dose despite receiving supportive care.

Dosing: 55 kBq (1.49 microcurie) per kg IV infused over 1 minute; repeat q4weeks for 6 cycles total

Perform hematologic evaluation at baseline and prior to every dose. 

Adverse Effects:  most common (at least 10 percent) adverse reactions in patients receiving radium 223 dichloride were nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, and peripheral edema. The most common (at least 10 percent) hematologic laboratory abnormalities were anemia, lymphocytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. Two percent of patients treated with radium 223 dichloride experienced bone marrow failure or ongoing pancytopenia.

I reviewed with the patient the potential option of radium-223. This is a radionuclide which was shown in a Phase III trial (ALSYMPCA: Alpharadin in Symptomatic Prostate Cancer Patients) which randomized men with castration-resistant prostate cancer to either radium-223 (6 IV injections, one q 4 weeks) + best standard of care vs placebo + best standard of care.  An overall survival benefit was seen in all subgroups of men who received radium-223, regardless of the extent of disease or if they had previously received docetaxel, or were currently being treated with bisphosphonates.  The men who received radium-223 also had a longer time to first skeletal-related event (bone fracture, spinal cord compression, or the need for radiation to treat bone-related symptoms), as well as improved quality of life.  Men who have 2 or more symptomatic bone metastases and no visceral metastases are candidates for treatment with radium-223.  Concurrent chemotherapy is not advised.  Radium-223 is an alpha-particle emitter, with a range less than 100 microns; therefore, it should result in much less bone marrow toxicity than was seen with Strontium and Samarium utilized in the past.  The retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy on his recent CT is small volume whereas the pt's bone mets are extensive, therefore he is definitely still a candidate for Radium-223.  After full discussion, he is interested in proceeding with Radium-223.  

 

I discussed potential acute and chronic side effects associated with radium-223 which include but are not limited to:   diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, leg swelling, and decreased blood counts due to bone marrow suppression, radiation-induced second cancers. 

 

Plan is to get PSA, total testosterone, and CBC and then plan for first injection of Radium 1 week later.

The ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer testing solution addresses false-negative biopsy concerns, helping urologists:  

“Rule-out” otherwise cancer-free men from undergoing unnecessary repeat biopsies and screening procedures, helping to reduce complications, patient anxiety and excessive healthcare expenses associated with these procedures.

“Rule-in” high-risk men with a previous negative biopsy result who may be harboring undetected cancer (false-negative biopsy result) and therefore may benefit from a repeat biopsy and potentially treatment.

Role of /chemotherapy — Chemotherapy in conjunction with RT does not have an established role as part of a combined modality approach for high-risk or locally advanced prostate cancer. However, results from three trials using docetaxel-based chemotherapy suggest that this option can be considered in selected cases:



●In the GETUG 12 trial, 413 patients with high-risk localized prostate cancer were randomly assigned to the combination of docetaxel, prednisone, and estramustine in conjunction with ADT for three years, or ADT alone [52]. Definitive local therapy (RT in 87 percent of cases) was given three months after initiation of treatment. With a median follow-up of 8.8 years, there was a trend toward improvement in the eight-year RFS rate with chemotherapy plus ADT versus ADT alone (62 versus 50 percent, HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.54-0.94).

●In the RTOG 0521 trial, 562 evaluable patients were treated with ADT for two years, beginning eight weeks prior to RT (72 to 75 Gy). Those randomly assigned to chemotherapy also received docetaxel (75 mg/m2)plus prednisone for six cycles beginning four weeks after RT. All patients had high-risk disease: median serum PSA was 15.1 ng/mL, 53 percent had Gleason 9 or 10 disease, and 27 percent had clinical T3 or T4 disease.
Preliminary results of the RTOG 0521 trial were presented at the 2015 ASCO meeting [53]. At a median follow-up of 5.5 years, overall survival was improved with adjuvant chemotherapy (four-year overall survival rate 93 versus 89 percent, HR 0.68, 95% CI 0.44-1.03). The disease-free survival was improved with the addition of chemotherapy compared with ADT alone (five-year disease-free survival rate 73 versus 66 percent, HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57-1.00). Additional follow-up is required to further assess the impact on overall survival.

●Additional evidence supporting a potential role for chemotherapy in high-risk patients comes from the STAMPEDE trial, which included men with both metastatic disease and high-risk M0 disease [51]. In that trial, 22 percent of patients had no evidence of lymph node or distant metastases (N0M0), and 14 percent had lymph node, but not distant, metastases (N+M0). The results of that trial are discussed separately (See "Initial systemic therapy for castration sensitive prostate cancer", section on 'STAMPEDE trial'.)

From AH: For intermediate-risk prostate cancer, the best data for the use of short-term androgen deprivation concurrent with radiation is from RTOG 9408. This phase III trial randomized 1979 patients to 4 months of total androgen suppression. After a median f/u period of 9.1 years, the 10-year rate of overall survival was 62% among patients receiving radiotherapy plus short-term ADT (the combined-therapy group), as compared with 57% among patients receiving radiotherapy alone (hazard ratio for death with radiotherapy alone, 1.17; P=0.03). The addition of short-term ADT was associated with a decrease in the 10-year disease-specific mortality from 8% to 4% (hazard ratio for radiotherapy alone, 1.87; P=0.001). Biochemical failure, distant metastases, and the rate of positive findings on repeat prostate biopsy at 2 years were significantly improved with radiotherapy plus short-term ADT. Reanalysis according to risk showed reductions in overall and disease-specific mortality primarily among intermediate-risk patients, with no significant reductions among low-risk patients. The intermediate-risk patients who received short-term ADT saw an increase in the 10-year rate of overall survival from 54 to 61% (hazard ratio for death with radiotherapy alone, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.49) and a reduction in the 10-year disease-specific mortality from 10 to 3% (hazard ratio, 2.49; 95% CI, 1.50 to 4.11).

[Epub ahead of print] Optimum Tools for Predicting Clinical Outcomes in Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review of Prognostic Accuracy and Validity. Campbell JM1, Raymond E2, O'Callaghan ME3, Vincent AD4, Beckmann KR5, Roder D6, Evans S7, McNeil J7, Millar J8, Zalcberg J7, Borg M9, Moretti KL10. Author information Abstract Prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease whose therapies frequently have adverse effects. Informed patient counseling regarding likely clinical outcomes is therefore important. In this systematic review we aimed to identify all external validations of tools that are used to predict clinical outcomes in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy and evaluate which are optimum for clinical implementation. PubMed and EMBASE were searched from 2007 to 2016. Search terms related to the inclusion criteria were: prostate cancer, clinical outcomes, radical prostatectomy, and prognosis. Titles and abstracts were screened and relevant studies were advanced to full-text review. Reference lists were reviewed for further studies. The Centre for Evidence Based Medicine prognostic tool was used for critical appraisal. Seventy-three studies externally validated 13 pre- and 41 postoperative tools for the prediction of biochemical recurrence (BCR), aggressive BCR, metastasis, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (PCSM). Recommendations for clinical implementation were made on the basis of accuracy, cohort sizes, and consistency. The accuracy of recommended tools ranged from 68% to 79% and 72% to 92% among the largest validation cohorts for pre- and postoperative tools. For preoperative prognosis we recommended the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) and Stephenson nomograms for BCR, the CAPRA nomogram for aggressive BCR as well as metastasis, and the D'Amico criteria for PCSM. For postoperative prognosis we recommended the CAPRA-Surgery (CAPRA-S), Stephenson, Kattan, Duke prostate cancer (DPC), and the Suardi nomograms for the prediction of BCR, the DPC nomogram for aggressive BCR, the CAPRA-S and Eggener nomograms for metastasis, and the Eggener nomogram for PCSM. Use of these tools should help clinicians deliver accurate, evidence-based counseling to patients undergoing prostatectomy.

The new era of PSMA PET:

Interestingly, some have argued that as imaging techniques improve, it is possible that salvage treatment could be deferred until the site of recurrent disease is detected. Men with metastatic disease could then avoid local or loco-regional RT, whereas RT could be tailored according to the presence of localized or oligometastatic disease. The former counterintuitive argument suggests that patients with metastatic disease will show up later than potentially curable patients with microscopic pelvic only disease. Likewise, the latter argument that only the PSMA-PET disease needs to be addressed assumes that PSMA-PET is a perfect test, which is an assumption known to be false. This is a point of important controversy as, although CaPs can importantly differ clinically, the efficacy (or non-inferiority) of such strategy has never been prospectively proven. The bulk of evidence favors early interventions and, while novel imaging modalities have shown improved detection rates, they do not provide optimal sensitivity at very low PSA levels. Recently, Emmet et al. showed that PSMA PET is independently predictive of treatment response to radiation, and stratifies men into a high treatment response to SRT (negative or fossa confined PSMA) versus men with poor response to SRT (nodes or distant disease PSMA). A negative PSMA-PET therefore was a strong predictor of a high response to SRT to the prostate bed (83).

 For low PSA values, salvage radiotherapy of the prostate fossa should not be omitted in case of PSMA-negativity. The probability of lasting PSA response after radiotherapy is probably highest for local recurrence, intermediate for regional and distant lymph node recurrences and lowest for bone metastases.
