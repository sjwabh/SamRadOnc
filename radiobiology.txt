DNA Repair - 5 repair processes

1) /NER - Nucleotide-Excision Repair (SSB repair): XP, Cockayne syndrome, trichothiodystrophy

2) /BER - Base-Excision Repair (SSB repair): No known diseases. most common mechanism in spontaneous mutations. DNA glycosylase, AP endonuclease

3) /MMR - Mismatch repair. Does not increase radiation sensitivity cuz not involved in repairing radiation damage. e.g., HNPCC

4) /HR - Homologous Recombination (DSB repair), error-free, G2

RAD5x, RPA (Replication Protein A), MRE11/MRE-11 (Meiotic recombination 11)

Rad50/MRE11/NBS is a direct phosphorylation target with ATM and forms a complex Rad50/MRE11/NBS to find damage in yeast.  This complex possesses nuclease activity that is necessary for DNA dsb repair.  

What is PTLD?

5) /NHEJ - Non-homologous End Joining: error-prone recombination, G1,

impaired VDJ recombination.

/LQ Linear Quadratic Model

/alpha (1/Gy): single hit, nonrepairable, intrinsic radiation sensitivity, not sens to fractionation.  Terminal deletions are single hit, so linear.

/beta (1/Gy^2): result of >=2 ionizing events, repairable by SLDR

Acute effects: overall treatment time is most important factor

The α/β ratio is greater for neutrons than protons, cuz less curvy.

/Linear-Quadratic-Linear /LQL model for SBRT, hypofractionation.

READ THIS:

http://www.eyephysics.com/tdf/models.htm

To better address hypofractionation regimens (e.g. SBRT, SRS) which employ very high dose fractions Guerrero and Li (5) modified the LQ model to better fit iso-effect data at high doses. Park et al. (6) later proposed that the LQ model transition to the historic multitarget (MT) model above a specified dose DT. TDF Plan implements the transition to a linear tail at high dose using the LQ-L model described by Astrahan (7).

In the standard LQ formalism, the surviving fraction (SF) and biologically effective dose per fraction (BEDn) are expressed as:

SF = e-(αD+βD2)

and

BEDn = En/α = (D + D2/(α/β))

To transition to a linear model for very high dose fractions the standard LQ model can be extended to a bipartite LQα/β-LDTform which can be expressed as:

SF = e-(αD+βD2) for fraction size D < DT

and

SF = e-(αDT+βDT2+γ(D−DT)) for fraction size D >= DT

BEDn = (D + D2/(α/β)) for fraction size D < DT

and

BEDn = DT + DT2/(α/β) + [(γ/α)(D−DT)] for fraction size D >= DT

where DT is the dose at which the survival curve becomes linear and γ is the the cell kill per Gy in this high dose linear portion of the survival curve. The term γ is thus reminiscent of D0 (the dose that reduces survival by 1/e in the final linear portion of the survival curve) of the older multitarget survival model, but is more in keeping with the Greek nomenclature of the LQ model. The γ/α ratio can be calculated from the tangent at DT and the α/β term of the standard LQ model as:

γ/α = 1 + (2DT/(α/β))

Ellis /NSD formula

NSD = D * T^-.11 * N^-.24

D = total dose

T = overall treatment time

N = # fractions

was derived from orthovoltage 2Gy/day from skin data.

Doesn’t account for late effects (alpha beta).

/Ch4 /Ch5

/Cell Cycle - sensitivity varies by 2.5-3.

Most sensitive in G2/M

next most sensitive is Late G1/Early S.

Most resistant in Late S, Early G1.

G2/M, G1, Early S, Late S

No shoulder for M phase cells!

/Checkpoint arrest

RT-induced cell cycle delay is

1-2 min per cGy, or

2 hrs per Gy

G2/M checkpoint: (to allow for HR)

/SLDR - Sublethal Damage Repair- takes .5-1.5 hrs.

Shoulder, Split dose (recapitulates shoulder). damage accumulated or repaired.

SLDR has fast and slow components.

SLDR experiment demonstrates 3 of the 4 R's of radiobiology:

Repair, Redistribution, Repopulation.  (Reoxygenation not applicable in vitro)

alpha is dominant component for fractionated, cuz it can't be repaired.

beta component can be repaired.

/PLDR - Potentially Lethal Damage Repair- PP:  Plateau phase, Proliferation-dependent: contact inhibit cells, irradiate, the more time you give it before restarting, the more time they have to repair damage. Dose and Time dependent.

/Ch6 - /Oxygen Effect /Hypoxia – induces apoptosis, selects for p53 mutants

/OER – ratio of dose w/o O2 to dose w/ O2.

Decreases at lower doses.

about 3 at high doses

about 2 at low doses

OER for x-rays varies with the cell cycle:

OER

S 2.8

G1 2.6

G2 2.4

Neutrons have lower OER of 1.6 compared to 2.5-3.0 for photons, protons.

0.5% (3mmHg) O2 concentration yields OER of half-max, ~2.

5% (30mmHg=Torr) => OER at max.

Acute hypoxia - vessels temp closing.

Chronic hypoxia- limited diffusion range 70 um.

tumors hypoxic fraction usually 10-15%.  (higher for H&N and cervical)

Measure tumor oxygenation:

Probes: measure regional O2

 Eppendorf probe- used in cervix trial, can get spatial profile

 OxyLite fiber-optic probe

MRI:

  BOLD- blood o2 dependent level

  EPR- Electron paramagnetic resonance (inject paramagnetic contrast agent)

PET: I-123 (IAZA), F-18/F-MISO

Hypoxic Cell Sensitizers (-azoles)

Immunohistochemical staining

  CA9- carbonic anhydrase 9

  /HIF1- hypoxia inducible factor

Usually under normal aerobic conditions, HIF1 is hydroxylated and degraded.

    Under hypoxia, no hydroxylation, upregulates VEGF, iNOS, bFGF (stimulates angiogenesis), EPO, Glut1, apoptosis, TGF-beta, HSP70, RAD51.

Hypoxia decreases BRCA1.

/Ch7 LET & RBE

/LET = average energy per unit length (keV/um)

Track Average: divide into equal track lengths

Energy Average: divide into equal energy intervals

(usually TA = EA,  except for neutrons: TA=12,  EA=100)

For a given particle type, the higher the energy, the lower the LET.

Typical LET values:

Electrons

.01 MeV 2.3

1.0 MeV .25

Photons

250 kV Xrays 2.0

Co-60 (1.25MeV) 0.2

Boron Neutron Capture Therapy –slow neutrons (.025 eV) have best boron cross section

Spallation products: Produces recoil protons, alpha particles and Li ions.  

RBE for neutrons: 1.5 to 2.6 ??

Neutron contamination for 16-25x is .5% inside field, .1% outside of field

Fast neutrons have similar depth dose curves as Cobalt.

3-4 Gy, 450 cGy (if no support)

Supportive Treatment:

If 4-5 Gy -> observation, abx for infxn, platelets if bleeding, no prophylactic RBCs yet.

If >5 Gy, abx for infxn.

If 8-10 Gy, bone marrow transplant window!

/Ch9 /Radioprotectors

/DRF - Dose Reduction Factor: Dose (in presence)/ Dose (absence)

Glutathione is an endogenous radioprotector, works by donating a Hydrogen.

Thiol (sulfhydryl (SH)) compounds: cysteine, cysteamine,

1) scavengers of free radicals,

2) hydrogen atom donation.

SH group needs to be covered by PHOSPHATE group to decrease toxicity.

Most effective for low LET.

/Amifostine (/Ethyol) (WR-2721) - prodrug, SH covered by PHOSPHATE to decrease toxicity.

Dephosphorylated by Alk Phosphatase to WR-1065.

Doesn't cross BBB.

Doesn't protect tumor cuz:

 Differential incr uptake in normal tissues (active transport, hydrophilic)

 less AP in tumor cells.

Decreases pneumonitis.  LOOK THIS UP.

/pentoxifylline - radioprotector. interrupts cytokine cascades -> interferes w/ RT fibrosis.

/Ch10 - Radiation Carcinogenesis /RT-induced

Deterministic - threshhold, cataract

Stochastic - no threshhold, RT-induced cancer

Historical Examples of RT carcinogenesis:

Skin Cancer - Xray workers, radiologists

Lung Ca: uranium ore miners, breathe radon gas -> alpha particles

Bone tumors: radium dial painters, Ra-224 for TB, ankylosing spondylitis

Leukemia - radiologists, spine RT for ankylosing spondylitis, but CLL never RT-induced.

Thyroid CA – pre-pubertal are most sensitive, most are well-differentiated papillary

 Hiroshima/ Nagasaki from I-131 fallout (children)

 RT for goiter

 RT to epilate for tinea capitis

BreastCA - mult fluoroscopies for induced ptx for TB, RT for postpartum mastitis

Ankylosing spondylitis => L-S Xrays -> leukemia & lung CA

Hiroshima/ Nagasaki:  Statistically significant increases in non-cancer disease mortality with increasing radiation dose have been observed, particularly for diseases of the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems. There is also an increased risk of heart disease among people who were exposed to doses less than 5 Gy.

Chernobyl – only thyroid CA

/Latency /Latent Period for XRT-induced /second malignancies

shortest latency is 2-5-7 yrs for leukemia.

5 yrs for thyroid CA.

solid tumors 10-50 yrs, average 20 yrs.

Highest risk in the field and edge of the field.

Latency for Early effects is only dependent on cell turnover time, Independent of radiation total dose, fractionation, or total treatment time.

Latency for Late effects IS dependent on Total Dose.

3 risk models:

 absolute risk: unrelated to spontaneous levels.

 relative risk: increases spontaneous risk by a factor.

 time-dependent relative risk - function of dose, square of dose, age at exposure, time since exposure, gender.

radium dial painters

 bone sarcoma incidence proportional to DOSE SQUARED.

 radon gas causes sinus tumors.

ratio of radiation-induced solid tumors to leukemias:

6         to     1

Younger age more susceptible to solid tumors (thyroid, breast).

susceptibility to RT-induced leukemias is independent of age?

ICRP Risks of Cancer Mortality (per Sv)

HighDose LowDose (<.2Sv) Hered Risk

Working Population 8% 4% .1%

Whole Population 10% 5% .2%

Nonfatal cancer risk = genetic disorder risk = .8-1%/Sv.

absolute mutation rate is .1-.6% per Sv.

Background risk of CA

1 in 2, and 1 in 2 of those will eventually die of CA (25%).

Japanese survivors, dose response relationship per BEIR V and UNSCEAR

Below 3 Sv, dose relationship for

solid tumors: linear

leukemias: linear-quadratic

In utero Xray (1 cGy) risk of childhood cancer increases:

 relative risk 40% (1.5x) per 1 cGy

 absolute risk 6% per 100 cGy

1% of all leukemias are attributable to diagnostic radiology (BEIR V)

UNSCEAR esimates that 4% of all cancer deaths are from radiation, mostly natural background.

1-6% of spontaneous mutations are due to background radiation exposure.

/SMN /secondary malignancies:

Conventional RT: Risk is 1.5%  q 10 yrs
IMRT: doubled risk: 3% at 10 yrs
Leukemia latency: 5-7 yrs

https://www.cancer.org/treatment/survivorship-during-and-after-treatment/long-term-health-concerns/second-cancers-in-adults/treatment-risks.html
LEUKEMIA (within several years) : 
 risk proportional to marrow in field
 Chemo is known to be a greater risk factor than radiation therapy in causing leukemia.

SOLID TUMORS (>10yrs) : 
  risk proportional to age & RTdose
  Certain organs, such as the breast and thyroid, seem to have a higher risk 


After Prostate RT: 34%, mostly bladder,lung.

/Boice et al: 150,000 cervical pts after RT:
Increased risk of cancer of bladder (4x), rectal, vagina, bone, uterine, NHL.
Did NOT incr risk of SI, colon, ovarian, vulva, breast, HD, MM, CLL.

Boice et al. have ranked various body tissues with regard to cancer induction by radiation; certain sites, such as the thyroid, female breast, and bone marrow, clearly are more radiosensitive than others.

/Ch11 Hereditary Effects of RT

Male /sterility

no change in hormones, libido, cuz Sertoli & Leydig cells are radioresistant.

New 6th ed Hall, Table 11.1:

Male

Temporary

 oligospermia 15 cGy after latency of 6 wks.

 azospermia  50-100 cGy.

    Recovery: 1yr for 1Gy, 2yrs for 2Gy.

Permanent

6-8 Gy single fx

2.5-3Gy fractionated over 2-4 wks causes permanent sterility.

Fractionated doses cause more damage (counter-intuitive)! Cuz stem cells are dividing infrequently.

Latency of 2 months (74 days?).

Stem cells = Type A spermatogonia – long cycle, divide infrequently (74d),

very RT-sensitive

_____ Spermatogonia – differentiating

Spermatocyte, type 1

Spermatocyte, type 2

4 Spermatids

Spermatozoa=Sperm (74 days) (least RT-sensitive)

Female /sterility:  no latency, no temporary!

permanent 12Gy prepubertal

2Gy  postmenop

also causes hormonal change, menopause

amenorrhea 4-7 Gy (acute), 12-15Gy (fractionated)

Females should wait 6 mos after radionuclide therapy before getting pregnant.

Males should wait 2 mos before initiating pregnancy, or maybe 6 mos.

3 categories of hereditary diseases

Mendelian - predictable inheritance pattern

Chromosomal - RT makes reciprocal-exchange type, not Robertsonian.

Multifactorial - congenital abnormalities

/MegaMouse Project (relative mutation risk): 5 major conclusions:

1. Radiosensitivity of different mutations varies by a factor of 35.

2. a big Dose Rate effect: .8 cGy/min to 90 cGy/min (1-100 cGy/min)

3. Male is more radiosensitive than the Female, esp at LDR.

4. Delaying conception after RT causes FEWER mutations. (for humans, recommend 2 mos for males, 6 mos for females)

5. Doubling dose is 1 Gy (probably low)

Doubling Dose: RT dose required to produce same rate of hereditary mutations as the spontaneous rate.

PURPOSE: The local failure rate in patients with locoregionally advanced cervical cancer is 41-72% after radiotherapy (RT) alone, whereas local control is a prerequisite for cure. The Dutch Deep Hyperthermia Trial showed that combining RT with hyperthermia (HT) improved 3-year local control rates of 41-61%, as we reported earlier. In this study, we evaluate long-term results of the Dutch Deep Hyperthermia Trial after 12 years of follow-up. METHODS AND MATERIALS: From 1990 to 1996, a total of 114 women with locoregionally advanced cervical carcinoma were randomly assigned to RT or RT+HT. The RT was applied to a median total dose of 68 Gy. The HT was given once weekly. The primary end point was local control. Secondary end points were overall survival and late toxicity. RESULTS: At the 12-year follow-up, local control remained better in the RT+HT group (37% vs. 56%; p=0.01). Survival was persistently better after 12 years: 20% (RT) and 37% (RT+HT; p=0.03). World Health Organization (WHO) performance status was a significant prognostic factor for local control. The WHO performance status, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage, and tumor diameter were significant for survival. The benefit of HT remained significant after correction for these factors. European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Grade 3 or higher radiation-induced late toxicities were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: For locoregionally advanced cervical cancer, the addition of HT to RT resulted in long-term major improvement in local control and survival without increasing late toxicity. This combined treatment should be considered for patients who are unfit to receive chemotherapy. For other patients, the optimal treatment strategy is the subject of ongoing research.

/neurofibromatosis: nf1, nf2 
/nf2, schwannomatosis 

/nf1, von Recklinghausen disease, is most common
AD inheritance
hallmarks of NF1 are multiple café-au-lait macules, axillary and/or inguinal freckling, Lisch nodules (iris hamartomas), and neurofibromas. Osseous dysplasias, symptomatic optic pathway glioma (OPG) 
Neurofibromas are benign peripheral nerve sheath tumors

"segmental NF1" is when clinical features are limited to one area of the body due to somatic mosaicism of a pathogenic variant

 The clinical behavior of gliomas in adults with NF1 is often aggressive, even for patients with low-grade tumors

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors — MPNSTs, previously called neurofibrosarcomas
highly malignant tumor
(PET) imaging may be helpful in distinguishing MPNST from benign plexiform or nodular neurofibromas

Females with NF1, particularly those under 50, are at increased risk of breast cancer, tend to be estrogen receptor negative and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive and are associated with a younger age at diagnosis and less favorable prognosis than non-NF1-associated breast cancers
