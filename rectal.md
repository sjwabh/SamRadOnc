Surgeries:

/APR - Abdominoperineal Resection. 2 incisions.

/TME : total mesorectal excision: sharp dissection thru fascia around mesorectum (fold of peritoneum connecting upper rectum w/ sacrum).  Excise peri-rectal fat and peri-rectal LNs as 1 specimen all the way back to the sacrum, including presacral nodes.

Who gets RT?

PreOp:

Any T3 or N+. (even T2N1!)

PostOp:

For what stages should we do postop RT?

Kachnic says still same, outside of a clinical trial: T3 or N+.

/Gunderson Pooled Analysis, JCO 2004, Intergroup pooled analysis by T & N stage,

"DOI: 10.1200/JCO.2004.08.173"

3791 pts from 5 trials.

All PostOp Therapy only.

Below compares PostOp ChemoRT vs PostOp Chemo:

Intermed Risk:

 T1-2N1: No LC benefit (5yr LR 5%), No OS benefit (78-85%)

 T3N0:  Yes LC benefit (5yr LR 5% v 11%), but no OS benefit (80-85%)

Mod Risk:

 T3N1: Improved 5yr LR (9% v 17%), and Improved OS (73% v 52%)

 T4N0: Improved 5yr LR (10% v 20%), OS (80% v 70%)

Can we skip PostOp RT for pT3N0? Maybe for >10cm from AV, low risk of LR.

/Rectal Studies:

At least THREE trials show why you need chemo:

PostOp CRT:

GITSG 7175 4-arm (NEJM '85, NEJM ’86, Radiother Onc '88, PMID 3064191): Need PostOp CRT.

For B2 or C, (T3 or N1-3),

PostOp CRT improved OS, RR, LF.

4 arm trial:

 1 Surgery alone

 2 PostOp Chemo (5FU & Methyl-CCNU (Semustine))

 3 PostOp RT 40-48

 4 PostOp CRT (best): 40-44 Gy + 5FU

Compared to surgery alone,

CRT Improved OS (45% v 27% @10yrs), Improved DFS.

Improved Time To Recurrence.

Decreased Recurrence Rate (33% v 55%),

Decreased LF Rate (10% v 25%).

NCCTG 794751 / Mayo Clinic trial (Krook, NEJM ’91, PMID 1997835): Need PostOp chemo w/ RT.

For B2 or C.

PostOp CRT (5FU/ Semustine) better than PostOp RT (45 + 5.4).

Improved 5 yr OS (58% v 48%), DFS, 7-yr LRR (14% v 25%). (unsure of %'s)

/NSABP Rectal Trials

/R01 (JNCI 1988): Dukes B2 or C (T3 or N1-2): At least need Chemo.

PostOp MOF vs PostOp XRT vs Observation.

PostOp MOF improved OS (60% v 37% @5yrs), DFS (47% v 29% @ 5yrs).

XRT almost reduced 5yr LRR rate (16% v 25%, p=.06), but no diff in OS, DFS.

increase resectability, sphincter preservation, nodal downstage,

Better oxygenated tumor / better tumor perfusion.

can use higher chemo doses, decrease seeding during surgery

less small bowel (still mobile, no adhesions, prone)

PostOp Adv: more accurate path stage available, avoid overtreat early disease, earlier surgery

Randomized trial of short-course radiotherapy versus long-course chemoradiation comparing rates of local recurrence in patients with T3 rectal cancer: Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group trial 01.04.
Three-year LR rates between SC and LC were not statistically significantly different; the CI for the difference is consistent with either no clinically important difference or differences in favor of LC. LC may be more effective in reducing LR for distal tumors. No differences in rates of distant recurrence, relapse-free survival, overall survival, or late toxicity were detected.  (But Bujko doesn't even think that this study proves that LC may be more effective for LR for distal tumors.)

/Tx Rectal /Rectal Tx, by Stage:

If T1 after WLE has bad margins, poorly diff or LVI or PNI, consider adjuvant chemoRT.

If after WLE it turns out to be a pT2 (16% LRF after WLE), you should either:

1) re-resect w/ TME, or 2) post-op chemoRT (reduces LRF from 20% to 7%).

Preferred option is TME alone (no adjuv anything is needed, per Willet).

/RTOG /0822, Phase II. Follow up to 0247, to see if IMRT can reduce GI toxicities.

Rectal CA

PreOp ChemoRT w/ IMRT and Xeloda & Oxaliplatin, surgery, then post-op FOLFOX.

Opened 4/2008

Pelvic IMRT 45Gy, 3DCRT boost 5.4Gy w/ 2cm margin AND presacral space.

Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2015 Sep 1;93(1):29-36. doi: 10.1016/j.ijrobp.2015.05.005. Epub 2015 May 14.

Thirty-five patients (51.5%) experienced grade ≥ 2 GI toxicity, 12 patients (17.6%) experienced grade 3 or 4 diarrhea, and pCR was achieved in 10 patients (14.7%).

The use of IMRT in neoadjuvant chemoradiation for rectal cancer did not reduce the rate of GI toxicity.

/timing of surgery: Need to wait at least 6-8 wks.

/Francois et al, JCO 1999

Lyon 9001 trial

2wks vs 8 wks delay.

Better tumor response (72% vs. 53%) and pathological downstaging (26% vs. 10%) with longer waits

pCR: 28.7% vs. 15.2%

A trend towards increased sphincter preservation in the LI group (76% vs. 68%)

Longer delay better.

Should we wait even longer?

/City of Hope timing trial.

If good response to preop CRT, less or no surgery?

New trial to study this: Maastricht University, Netherlands

/RECTAL FOLLOW-UP:

F/U: q3mos x 2 yrs, then q6mos x 5 yrs.

Only check CEA if initially elevated to follow post-op, q3-6mo x2yrs, then q6mo to 5yrs.

Proctoscopy q6mo x5yrs to check anastomosis for local recurrence.

Colonoscopy @ 1 yr, then q3yr (routine).

CTcap q1yr x 3 yrs.

/Papillion

endocavitary brachytherapy 50kV

30Gy x 3-4 = 90-120Gy.

/Anemia in Rectal CA

Lee, IJCD 2009, " DOI 10.1007/s00384-009-0762-7"

Hb<9 has worse tumor response.

Berardi, AO 2006, " doi:10.1093/annonc/mdl285"

Hb<12 has worse DFS.

neoadjuv chemo

moving toward total neoadjuv therapy

/PROSPECT is a randomized trial for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer comparing standard of care chemoradiation followed by surgery with neoadjuv Chemotherapy alone (FOLFOX) followed by surgery.
NEJM 2023
DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa2303269

CONCLUSION: preoperative FOLFOX was noninferior to preoperative chemoradiotherapy wrt DFS.
MyComments: But the control arm (PreOp CRT) only 'suggested' adjuv FOLFOX, did not mandate it, so does this mean the comparator control arm outcomes might be inferior to the current standard?
This trial excluded pts w/ >=4 +nodes (>10mm) on pre op imaging.

/TNT /total neoadjuvant therapy for rectal CA

12/10/2021 From UpToDate: Role of total neoadjuvant therapy

For most patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who are at high risk for a margin-positive resection (ie, T4 disease or an involved mesorectal fascia), as well as for those with clearly node-positive disease and a low-lying rectal tumor, or extramural venous invasion, we suggest total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT, ie, oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy combined with long-course CRT or short-course RT) rather than preoperative long-course CRT or short-course RT alone (Grade 2C). We suggest not pursuing this strategy in patients with lower-risk locally advanced cancers (ie, upper rectal T3N0 disease without a threatened mesorectal fascia) because these patients may not need chemotherapy at all (Grade 2C). (See 'Total neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors' above.)
