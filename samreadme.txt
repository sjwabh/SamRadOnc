On 12/11/2021 I retired my Google Sites version of SamRadOnc and made a collection of plain text files
Maybe I'd still like to include links to a few figures stored somewhere

Recommend treatment of the pelvic lymphatics given risk of microscopic involvement >20% as per POP-RT trial which showed an improved disease free survival with pelvic RT (90 vs 77%).

Regarding adjuvant Xeloda for breast CA:
Janelle sez:

I don't generally give it for ER/PR positive patients (unless they have very low ER/PR expression, and I am concerned it is more like a triple negative breast cancer). The benefit was really seen in the triple negative patients, and she will likely get more benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy.

Here are the criteria for the addition of adjuvant abemaciclib if she meets any of these:

High risk was defined as patients with four or more positive pathologic axillary lymph nodes or one to three positive axillary lymph nodes and at least one of the following: tumor size ≥ 5 cm, histologic grade 3, or centrally assessed Ki-67 ≥ 20%.

PMRT?

Morphea is a rare skin condition characterized by small red or purple patches that develop firm white or ivory centers. The affected skin becomes tight and less flexible. Morphea (mor-FEE-uh) is a rare condition that causes painless, discolored patches on your skin
 may be caused by an unusual reaction of your immune system. In people at increased risk of morphea, it could be triggered by injury to the affected area, medications, chemical toxins, an infection or radiation therapy.

Tx: vitD cream, topical steroid (clobetasol), UV phototherapy, oral MTX, oral steroids.

Tamoxifen is approximately 25% less effective than aromatase inhibitors for preventing recurrences of breast cancer.

PET/CT-Based Salvage Radiotherapy for Recurrent Prostate Cancer After Radical Prostatectomy: Impact on Treatment Management and Future Directions
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8438304/?report=reader

 PSMA PET/CT, with a 45% detection rate at PSA levels ranging from 0.2 to 0.49 ng/ml
 Considering actual evidence converging on the inverse correlation between the PSA level at SRT and long-term disease control of SRT, guidelines recommend use of early SRT to the PB at PSA level <0.5 ng/ml, even in absence of specific target (4). Noteworthy, very early SRT (PSA 0.01 to 0.2 ng/ml) was associated with a twofold decrease in biochemical failure, use of salvage ADT, and distant metastases compared to early SRT (PSA between 0.2 to 0.5 ng/ml) (87). Similarly, Fossati et al. also concluded that SRT should be given at the earliest sign of PSA rise, and even more so in case of adverse pathological findings (pT3b/pT4, Gleason score >8, positive surgical margins) (88). Also, the kinetics of PSA rise has an impact on OS, with a significant difference between patients with a PSA doubling time of less than 10 months (36). Could the addition of PET/CT to the design of these studies have affected outcomes? At the very least, it could have enabled the distinction between patients with and without macroscopic disease, resulting in a better homogeneity of the population. It is possible that the association between PSA level at SRT and outcome may be a bias related to the presence of macroscopic disease, and thus undertreatment of a certain proportion of this population. Still, it seems intuitive that providing SRT at a time when the disease is microscopic (and therefore undetectable on PET/CT) yields better outcomes in comparison with macroscopic disease. Indeed, in the study led by Emmett et al., patients who benefited the most from PB SRT were those with a negative PET/CT, with a 3-year freedom from progression evaluated at 82.5% (89, 90). The impact of PET/CT in SRT planning on long-term clinical outcomes is currently assessed by ongoing phase III trials (Table 2). While awaiting the results of these studies, a negative restaging PET/CT at BCR should not delay and alter the decision to perform SRT (4).
