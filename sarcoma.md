Normally, sarcomas not lymphatic spread, but hematogenous.

Synovial cell (15% LN risk) - (X-chromosome translocation, not Y) t(X;18), see calcified mass near jt

Clear Cell (28% risk) - hand and foot, tendons and aponeurosis of

Angiosarcoma (10% risk)- velvety dark red, scalp

Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) (15-20%)

Epithelioid (15-20%) (hands, forearms in young adults)

/Liposarcoma - retroperitoneum & LE, rarely metastasizes, and if it does, it goes to serosal surfaces, and NOT to lung.  Sometimes has elevated bHCG.

/paratesticular /testicular liposarcoma

 it is the most common histological subtype of genitourinary sarcomas in adults.  Radical orchidectomy with wide local excision comprises the cornerstone of treatment of paratesticular liposarcoma. Due to the rarity of the disease there is no definite universal consensus of opinion as regards the role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy.

PLs are often classified in four subtypes:

– well-differentiated

– myxoid and round cell

– pleomorphic

– de-differentiated

In cases of incomplete surgery, we suggest performing an immediate radical procedure. The low response to adjuvant treatments imposes extensive surgery as the only curative approach, even in cases of smaller and well-differentiated tumors, due to the high risk of local recurrence in cases of nonradical excision. To date, due to the rarity of PLs, the role of radiotherapy and chemotherapy has not yet been well established [3,7]. The literature researches show controversial results achieved after radiotherapy and chemotherapy, mainly based on doxorubicin.

Distant Recurrence predictors:

Prognostic Factors: (predictors of LC)

GRADE is most important factor for survival, DFS.

Complete Gross Resection is most important factor for retroperitoneal STS.

M+:  But are all positive margins equal? NO! Why? unplanned M+ (mistakenly cut thru tumor) is worst w/ 37% LR.

(UPDATE: ASCO 2004: No longer OS diff.)

190pts w/ extremity STS, who needed Surg+RT cuz couldn't get 2cm margins.

Pre (50Gy) (^wound healing probs) vs Post Op (66Gy) (^late fibrosis & edema)

If +M, Pre got PostOp 16Gy boost.

Initial Field: 5cm prox/distal margins to 50Gy.

Boost Field: 2cm margins, 16-20 Gy

Initially PreOp had better OS, but on 6yr FU, no diff OS. No LC diff.

PreOp had worse wound complic rate (35% v 17%), especially in LE > UE (43% v 5%),

but evidently wasn’t too bad cuz didn’t cause worse OS.

Late fibrosis 30-50% in postop.

But Late fibrosis (32% v 48%) & edema worse in PostOp (Davis, Radiotherapie Oncologie, 2005,

"doi:10.1016/j.radonc.2004.12.020")

So we still favor PreOp cuz wound complications tend to be reversible, late fibrosis/ edema not as reversible.

/DFSP /dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

Low metastatic potential.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is an uncommon locally aggressive cutaneous soft tissue sarcoma. Although they rarely metastasize (fewer than 5 percent of cases), all DFSP variants have a propensity to recur locally.

Tx: Resect w/ negative margins if possible.

Post-Op RT only if can’t get negative margins.

Use Gleevec if PDGF overexpression.

Imatinib for use in adult patients who have unresectable, recurrent, and/or metastatic DFSP.

May work even for pts w/o the translocation t(17;22).

Unclear if it has a role as adjuvant therapy for local disease.

The majority of local recurrences become evident within three years, but 25 to 30 percent develop after five years. The optimal posttreatment surveillance strategy has not been established. We and others [35] suggest that patients be examined every six months for the first three years, then annually lifelong.

The benefit of RT can be illustrated by our experience with 35 patients with DFSP of the trunk and extremities (18 untreated, 17 recurrent) treated surgically at the University of Florida between 1975 and 1996 [51]. Thirty-four had been initially operated on elsewhere with inadequate procedures (either marginal or intralesional resections). The margins at reexcision were wide in 28 patients, marginal in six, and intralesional in one patient. Of the seven patients with inadequate surgical margins, four received adjuvant RT.

With a median follow-up of 58 months, all 28 patients undergoing WLE were locally controlled, as were the four patients with inadequate margins who received adjuvant RT (mean 57.5 Gy; range 50 to 65 Gy).

Resection is curative in 90% of these tumors,280–283 whereas curettage, with or without bone grafts, has a recurrence rate of 40% to 75%.286 Johnson and Dahlin282 reported a recurrence rate of 29% within 1 year of curettage and of 54.1% within 5 years. O'Donnell et al.287 reviewed the literature from 1970 to 1990 and reported an overall recurrence rate of approximately 40%.

Local recurrence of a GCT is determined by the adequacy of surgical removal rather than histologic grade.

Between 8.6% and 22% of known GCTs become malignant after local recurrence.
