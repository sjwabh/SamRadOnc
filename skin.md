BWH staging for Skin SCC: 
4 High-Risk SCC Factors in BWH: DDPP
Diameter >2cm: Y/N
Depth beyond fat: Y/N (>6mm? >4mm?)
histopathology- Poor differentiation: Y/N
Perineural invasion >/= 0.1mm: Y/N
BWH staging is assigned giving 1 point to each of the above factors. (T1=0 factors, T2a=1 factor, T2b=2-3 factors, T3=4+ factors) 

Comparison of AJCC vs BWH staging for skin SCC:
Ruiz et al, JAMA Dermatol. 2019;
https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamadermatology/fullarticle/2729752
In this cohort study of 459 patients with 680 HNCSCC, twice as many tumors were classified as AJCC 8 (T3/T4) high tumor class compared with BWH (T2b/T3) high tumor classes (AJCC 8 18% vs BWH 9%). The AJCC 8 T2 and T3 comprised 23% of cases and had statistically indistinguishable outcomes, whereas the BWH had higher specificity (93%) and positive predictive value (30%) for identifying cases at risk for metastasis or death; C statistics showed BWH to be superior in predicting nodal metastasis and disease-specific death.

from WC, for high risk skin CA:  

Guidelines from the NCCN, the European Dermatology Forum, the European Association of Dermato Oncology, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and the American College of Radiology recommend the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) for:  
 
	Tumors with positive surgical margins after excision not amenable to further surgery  
	Tumors with clear margins that exhibit extensive PNI or large nerve involvement  


  
Radiation therapy to the primary site is considered in the following situations:  
   
	Patients with multiple high-risk features  
	PNI of unnamed nerves >0.1 mm in diameter  
	Multifocal tumor spread  
	Presence of microsatellitosis  
	Multiple tumor recurrences  
	Lymph node involvement  
	Massive local extension or intracranial invasion  
 
Data on the role of ART for high-risk primary cSCCs excised with clear surgical margins are limited, and there are no definitive recommendations on the indications for ART:  
 
	In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 observational studies and 1 randomized trial that included 3534 patients treated for cSCC of the head and neck, ART was associated with increased overall survival and disease-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0.45, 95% CI 0.26-0.78 and HR 0.52, 95% CI 0.33-0.84, respectively).  
	In a phase 3, randomized trial of ART with or without concurrent chemotherapy in patients with high-risk cSCC of the head and neck, high two- and five-year rates of freedom from locoregional relapse (88 and 83 percent, respectively) were achieved in the radiation therapy alone arm.  
	In a series of 349 patients with advanced head and neck cSCC treated with surgical resection with or without ART, ART was associated with improved overall survival (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.38-0.90). For patients with PNI, ART was associated with improved overall survival as well as disease-free survival (HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.24-0.86 and HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.93, respectively).

Risks: Blue-eyed blondes at highest risk, arsenic (Bowen's), chronic ulcers, oncoviruses

Other Prognostic Factors: primary vs recurrent, immunosuppressed,
Marjolin's ulcer (prior scar, burn) is worse.

Tests: CT/ MRI to R/O cartilage, bone involvement, orbit, nodes, CN involvement.

/PORT Indications Skin CA (SCC?)

From 2021 UpToDate:

"Guidelines from the NCCN, the European Dermatology Forum, the European Association of Dermato Oncology, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and the American College of Radiology recommend the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) for:

?Tumors with positive surgical margins after excision not amenable to further surgery
?Tumors with clear margins that exhibit extensive PNI or large nerve involvement

We also consider the use of ART to the primary site in the following situations:

?Patients with multiple high-risk features
?PNI of unnamed nerves >0.1 mm in diameter
?Multifocal tumor spread
?Presence of microsatellitosis
?Multiple tumor recurrences
?Lymph node involvement

SCC Skin High Risk Features: (from UpToDate, what year? still valid??)
extensive + PNI
Thickness: >2mm, >6mm
Diameter Size:  >2cm, >1cm, >0.6cm, depending on location

Location:

Local recurrence of cutaneous SCC is estimated to occur in 2 to 22 percent of lip tumors and 5 to 19 percent of ear tumors, and metastasis develops in 3 to 20 percent and 9 to 12 percent of these lesions, respectively [14]. The relatively thin nature of auricular skin and the low depth of invasion required for the tumor to invade the perichondrium (approximately 2 mm) may contribute to the increased risk for local recurrence observed with tumors on the ear. In addition, the proximity of the ear to the lymph nodes of the parotid gland and neck may be an important factor for metastasis.

Skin grafts: wait at least 6-8 wks, cover entire graft.


/Dose /RT Dose

PORT: 50-54Gy @2/day, boost to total dose of 56-66Gy.

DEFINITIVE: orthovoltage doses: (increase by 10-15% for e- or MV)
<2cm 300x15=45 or 400x10 BIW, 800x4 (BIW)
>2cm 250x20=50 (Larger area must use smaller daily fractions)
>2cm+cartilage 200x30=60 (Regine says 6600 (cuz MV?)) (when treating cartilage, always keep <300 cGy/d to avoid cartilage necrosis)

He said that it sounded as though I had multiple options on doses, and what would I do if not of cosmetic concern, or of more cosmetic concern..  I said 40/10, 45/15, 50/20, and 60/30fx were the main fractionation schemes I used, with longer fractionation for more cosmetically sensitive areas.  

Princess Margaret dose: 800x4 (BIW), 400x10=4000 BIW, 300x15=4500, 250x20=5000.

These are orthovoltage doses, which have RBE 10-15% higher than megavoltage e-, so increase total dose by 10-15% for e-, i.e., Give 500 cGy more if e-.  

Depth: Prescribe to at least 0.5cm deeper than max depth tumor.

Don't forget BOLUS and SKIN COLLIMATION and LEAD SHIELDS:

From SSY: For 1.5cm depth, use 9e- w/ 0.5cm bolus, prescribed to 90%. Treat 2cm margins.

For lip, dose 70Gy, treat bilateral Levels IA, IB, II w/ opposed lats to 50Gy.

Bolus! Use 0.5cm for 6e- will give 1.0cm depth.

Using 1cm for 9e- will give 1.25cm depth.

Skin collimation  - to reduce penumbra


RT Fields:

Margins:
0.5-1.0cm if <2cm
1.5-2cm if >2cm, or SCC, but only 1cm for medial canthus?
Add 0.5cm for e-.

If +PNI, include nerve path all the way to skull base.

The 5-year rates of local control (LC), lymph node control (NC), and sphincter preservation were 82%, 88%, and 96%, respectively. However, because of the high rate of distant metastasis, the overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years was only 30%. Although there were no significant differences in LC, NC, or OS based on RT field extent, patients who received extended-field RT had higher rates of lymphedema than patients who received limited-field RT.

Be cautious with steroid usage w/ Yervoy:

http://www.cancernetwork.com/melanoma/ipilimumab-shows-activity-metastatic-melanoma-patients-brain-metastases

The steroids taken by patients in cohort B may have had a negative effect on ipilimumab activity, the authors hypothesized. “The apparent low rate of benefit in this cohort suggests that further study is needed into patients with specific unfavorable prognostic factors and into avoidance of steroid use at the start of ipilimumab treatment,” the authors wrote. - See more at: http://www.cancernetwork.com/melanoma/ipilimumab-shows-activity-metastatic-melanoma-patients-brain-metastases#sthash.7GEAkWNf.dpuf

http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jsc/2013/423829/

 A review of data from three phase II studies of ipilimumab used at 10 mg/kg suggested that steroids do not influence the efficacy of ipilimumab, but the data must be interpreted with caution, since it was a retrospective analysis and patients were not randomized [40, 41]. It is well established, however, that steroids can reverse irAEs, and the mechanism of these reactions is identical to the mechanism of the antitumor activity of ipilimumab [12]

Tis - in situ

T1 - tumor <= 2 cm

T2 - >2 cm and <= 5 cm

T3 - > 5 cm

T4 - invades bone, muscle, fascia, or cartilage

Regional Lymph Nodes:

N0 - none

N1

N1a - micrometastasis

N1b - macrometastasis

N2 - in transit metastasis

defined as a tumor distinct from the primary tumor and either 1) between the primary and the nodal basin or 2) distal to the primary

Distant Metastases:

M0 - none

M1

M1a - metastasis to skin, subcutaneous tissues, or distant lymph nodes

M1b - metastasis to lung

M1c - metastasis to all other visceral sites

Stage Grouping:

IA - T1 pN0

IB - T1 cN0

IIA - T2-3 pN0

IIB - T2-3 cN0

IIC - T4 N0

IIIA - N1a

IIIB - N1b or N2

IV - M1

Note: prognostically, pN0 is better than cN0 (without pathologically confirmed node negativity) and thus pN0 vs cN0 is incorporated into overall staging, as is N1a vs N1b

Rx:

Surgery (wide excision). SNB. If SNB+, LND.

Can skip PORT iff:

<2cm

negative margins

SNB negative

no LVSI

not immunosuppressed

Almost always PostOp XRT dt High recurrence rate.

PORT improves DFS, Time to Recurrence, but does not improve OS.

Dose: 56Gy PORT to primary w/ 5cm margins, always treat lymphatics, 50Gy to LNs.

(56Gy if M-, 59Gy if M+, 66Gy if gross dz (Ang))

PostOp Chemo: Adria/ Cytoxan/ Vincristine, or CMF.

3yr OS

I 75%

II 55%

III 30%

The most common shorter course hypo-RT regimens were 45–50 Gy in 20 fractions over 4 weeks (n = 13) and 30–35 Gy in 10 fractions over 2 weeks (n = 8; Supporting Table 2).





















/AFX – atypical fibroxanthoma: a superficial form of MFH

Epid: older pts, H&N, prior sun or XRT exposure

PostOp treat to about 60Gy?

/KS /Kaposi's Sarcoma - HHV8 - any CD4, homosexual men only

 red-purple macules, plaques, nodules

 Non-AIDS: ankles, LEs, hands (Prognosis: chronic indolent course over 10-15 years)

 AIDS: face (nose, eyes, ears), visceral (GI, endobronchial lesions, perihilar opacities along septal lines)

oropharanx (painless)

LN or bone involvement rare.

Poor Prognostic Factors: oral site, GI site, edema, ulceration, CD4<200, h/o thrush, B sx, KPS<70, other HIV illnesses.

Workup:  HIV testing.

Bx carefully cuz bleeds easily!

RT: 2cm margins, 6e- w/ 0.5cm bolus (for flat lesions)

RT dose / fractionation:

Non-AIDS KS:

250x12=3000 (localized dz)

150x20=3000 (ankle, hand. avoids chronic edema & pain)

800x1 (extensive regional dz)

65-85% cCR, 90-95% (PR or CR)

AIDS KS:

800x1 (extensive regional dz & <3mo life expectancy)

250x12=3000 (small lesions & > 1 yr life-expectancy)

dose fractionation - balance cosmesis vs convenience

depends on lesion size / location, prior tx, symptoms, medical condition, life expectancy

(Old) 800x1, 3000/10, 4000/20.

200x12=2400. (2800 for AIDS)

20-40Gy.

e- for superficial.  

Other Tx: Intralesional or systemic vinblastine, systemic D-actinomycin. Cryotherapy.

/imiquimod (/Aldara)

 immune response modifier

skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease,[1]superficial squamous cell carcinoma, some superficial malignant melanomas, and actinic keratosis) as well as genital warts (condylomata acuminata). However, Imiquimod is generally secondary to surgery, because surgery has a better chance to effectively treat at least some forms of skin cancer.[2]

Imiquimod has been tested for treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Two large randomized controlled trials, however, found no evidence of effectiveness of imiquimod in treating children with molluscum contagiosum, and concerning adverse effects were also noted.[3]

Imiquimod has also been tested for treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, common warts that have proven difficult to treat,[4] and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia.[5]
