Risks: Blue-eyed blondes at highest risk, arsenic (Bowen's), chronic ulcers, oncoviruses

Other Prognostic Factors: primary vs recurrent, immunosuppressed,
Marjolin's ulcer (prior scar, burn) is worse.

Tests: CT/ MRI to R/O cartilage, bone involvement, orbit, nodes, CN involvement.

/BCC Basal Cell CA - MC skin CA. from basal layer of epidermis.
 Dose: Lower doses 30-50Gy.  Don't treat nodes, risk of mets is 1%.

TREATMENT OPTIONS:

Moh's procedure - take frozens & keep carving out slices until negative margins.
  works better for BCC than SCC.
Curretage and Electrodessication
cryotherapy
topical 5FU


Definitive RT favored over Surgery:

T-zone sites: ears, eyelid (lower), medial canthus, tip/ala nose, oral commisure, (>2cm on ears, forehead, scalp)
lip - RT better cosmesis, better function; Surgery causes small mouth, numb lip (Marlboro Man will burn his lip when smoking)

medical comorbidities
anticoagulants
multiple superficial lesions
prone to keloids
Pregnancy


Relative Contraindications to RT:

age<50
prior RT
Exposed cartilage or bone
connective tissue diseases
AT
CD4<200
overlying critical organ, hair bearing areas, overlying lacrimal gland.
upper eye lid (poor tolerance to RT)
poor vascularity (pretibial, below elbow)
over bony prominences

basal cell nevus (Gorlin's syndrome, Medullo) (forked ribs)





/PORT Indications Skin CA (SCC?)

From 2021 UpToDate:

"Guidelines from the NCCN, the European Dermatology Forum, the European Association of Dermato Oncology, the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer, and the American College of Radiology recommend the use of adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) for:

?Tumors with positive surgical margins after excision not amenable to further surgery
?Tumors with clear margins that exhibit extensive PNI or large nerve involvement

We also consider the use of ART to the primary site in the following situations:

?Patients with multiple high-risk features
?PNI of unnamed nerves >0.1 mm in diameter
?Multifocal tumor spread
?Presence of microsatellitosis
?Multiple tumor recurrences
?Lymph node involvement
?Massive local extension or intracranial invasion (see 'Tumors with skull base extension' below)



/PORT Skin Indications: >3MnIPHL

+M can't re-resect
PNI of named nerve
>3cm primary
invasion of muscle/bone/cartilage
Parotid SCC
poorly diff Histology
LN involvement

Nodal risk as high as 10% if SCC and:

>3cm primary
>4mm depth
poorly diff
recurrent
+ECE
lips


SCC Skin High Risk Features: (from UpToDate, what year? still valid??)
extensive + PNI
Thickness: >2mm, >6mm
Diameter Size:  >2cm, >1cm, >0.6cm, depending on location

Location:

Local recurrence of cutaneous SCC is estimated to occur in 2 to 22 percent of lip tumors and 5 to 19 percent of ear tumors, and metastasis develops in 3 to 20 percent and 9 to 12 percent of these lesions, respectively [14]. The relatively thin nature of auricular skin and the low depth of invasion required for the tumor to invade the perichondrium (approximately 2 mm) may contribute to the increased risk for local recurrence observed with tumors on the ear. In addition, the proximity of the ear to the lymph nodes of the parotid gland and neck may be an important factor for metastasis.

Skin grafts: wait at least 6-8 wks, cover entire graft.


/Dose /RT Dose

PORT: 50-54Gy @2/day, boost to total dose of 56-66Gy.

DEFINITIVE: orthovoltage doses: (increase by 10-15% for e- or MV)
<2cm 300x15=45 or 400x10 BIW, 800x4 (BIW)
>2cm 250x20=50 (Larger area must use smaller daily fractions)
>2cm+cartilage 200x30=60 (Regine says 6600 (cuz MV?)) (when treating cartilage, always keep <300 cGy/d to avoid cartilage necrosis)

He said that it sounded as though I had multiple options on doses, and what would I do if not of cosmetic concern, or of more cosmetic concern..  I said 40/10, 45/15, 50/20, and 60/30fx were the main fractionation schemes I used, with longer fractionation for more cosmetically sensitive areas.  

Princess Margaret dose: 800x4 (BIW), 400x10=4000 BIW, 300x15=4500, 250x20=5000.

These are orthovoltage doses, which have RBE 10-15% higher than megavoltage e-, so increase total dose by 10-15% for e-, i.e., Give 500 cGy more if e-.  

Depth: Prescribe to at least 0.5cm deeper than max depth tumor.

Don't forget BOLUS and SKIN COLLIMATION and LEAD SHIELDS:

From SSY: For 1.5cm depth, use 9e- w/ 0.5cm bolus, prescribed to 90%. Treat 2cm margins.

For lip, dose 70Gy, treat bilateral Levels IA, IB, II w/ opposed lats to 50Gy.

Bolus! Use 0.5cm for 6e- will give 1.0cm depth.

Using 1cm for 9e- will give 1.25cm depth.

Skin collimation  - to reduce penumbra


RT Fields:

Margins:
0.5-1.0cm if <2cm
1.5-2cm if >2cm, or SCC, but only 1cm for medial canthus?
Add 0.5cm for e-.

If +PNI, include nerve path all the way to skull base.

Intermediate: .76 to 1.5 mm

In-Transit LNs:  intralymphatic trapping of melanoma cells between the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes resulting from lymphadenectomy—either electively or guided by a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB)—may cause lymphatic stasis and trapping of melanoma cells.

RT 25-36Gy in 5-6fx, to primary tumor (15pts) and pelvic & inguinals (39pts) (EFRT didn't help & increased lymphedema)

The 5-year rates of local control (LC), lymph node control (NC), and sphincter preservation were 82%, 88%, and 96%, respectively. However, because of the high rate of distant metastasis, the overall survival (OS) rate at 5 years was only 30%. Although there were no significant differences in LC, NC, or OS based on RT field extent, patients who received extended-field RT had higher rates of lymphedema than patients who received limited-field RT.

Be cautious with steroid usage w/ Yervoy:

http://www.cancernetwork.com/melanoma/ipilimumab-shows-activity-metastatic-melanoma-patients-brain-metastases

The steroids taken by patients in cohort B may have had a negative effect on ipilimumab activity, the authors hypothesized. “The apparent low rate of benefit in this cohort suggests that further study is needed into patients with specific unfavorable prognostic factors and into avoidance of steroid use at the start of ipilimumab treatment,” the authors wrote. - See more at: http://www.cancernetwork.com/melanoma/ipilimumab-shows-activity-metastatic-melanoma-patients-brain-metastases#sthash.7GEAkWNf.dpuf

http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jsc/2013/423829/

 A review of data from three phase II studies of ipilimumab used at 10 mg/kg suggested that steroids do not influence the efficacy of ipilimumab, but the data must be interpreted with caution, since it was a retrospective analysis and patients were not randomized [40, 41]. It is well established, however, that steroids can reverse irAEs, and the mechanism of these reactions is identical to the mechanism of the antitumor activity of ipilimumab [12]

oropharanx (painless)

LN or bone involvement rare.

Poor Prognostic Factors: oral site, GI site, edema, ulceration, CD4<200, h/o thrush, B sx, KPS<70, other HIV illnesses.

Workup:  HIV testing.

Bx carefully cuz bleeds easily!

RT: 2cm margins, 6e- w/ 0.5cm bolus (for flat lesions)

RT dose / fractionation:

Non-AIDS KS:

250x12=3000 (localized dz)

150x20=3000 (ankle, hand. avoids chronic edema & pain)

800x1 (extensive regional dz)

65-85% cCR, 90-95% (PR or CR)

AIDS KS:

800x1 (extensive regional dz & <3mo life expectancy)

250x12=3000 (small lesions & > 1 yr life-expectancy)

dose fractionation - balance cosmesis vs convenience

depends on lesion size / location, prior tx, symptoms, medical condition, life expectancy

(Old) 800x1, 3000/10, 4000/20.

200x12=2400. (2800 for AIDS)

20-40Gy.

e- for superficial.  

Other Tx: Intralesional or systemic vinblastine, systemic D-actinomycin. Cryotherapy.

 immune response modifier

skin cancers (basal cell carcinoma, Bowen's disease,[1]superficial squamous cell carcinoma, some superficial malignant melanomas, and actinic keratosis) as well as genital warts (condylomata acuminata). However, Imiquimod is generally secondary to surgery, because surgery has a better chance to effectively treat at least some forms of skin cancer.[2]

Imiquimod has been tested for treatment of molluscum contagiosum. Two large randomized controlled trials, however, found no evidence of effectiveness of imiquimod in treating children with molluscum contagiosum, and concerning adverse effects were also noted.[3]

Imiquimod has also been tested for treatment of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia, common warts that have proven difficult to treat,[4] and vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia.[5]
